       "'FIRST ACT\\n\\n\\nSCENE\\n\\nMorning-room in Algernon’s flat in Half-Moon Street. The room is\\nluxuriously and artistically furnished. The sound of a piano is heard\\nin the adjoining room.\\n\\n[Lane is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and after the music has\\nceased, Algernon enters.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nDid you hear what I was playing, Lane?\\n\\nLANE.\\nI didn’t think it polite to listen, sir.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI’m sorry for that, for your sake. I don’t play accurately—any one can\\nplay accurately—but I play with wonderful expression. As far as the\\npiano is concerned, sentiment is my forte. I keep science for Life.\\n\\nLANE.\\nYes, sir.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nAnd, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber\\nsandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?\\n\\nLANE.\\nYes, sir. [Hands them on a salver.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.] Oh! . . . by the\\nway, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord\\nShoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of\\nchampagne are entered as having been consumed.\\n\\nLANE.\\nYes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWhy is it that at a bachelor’s establishment the servants invariably\\ndrink the champagne? I ask merely for information.\\n\\nLANE.\\nI attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir. I have often\\nobserved that in married households the champagne is rarely of a\\nfirst-rate brand.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nGood heavens! Is marriage so demoralising as that?\\n\\nLANE.\\nI believe it _is_ a very pleasant state, sir. I have had very little\\nexperience of it myself up to the present. I have only been married\\nonce. That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and\\na young person.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Languidly_._] I don’t know that I am much interested in your family\\nlife, Lane.\\n\\nLANE.\\nNo, sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it\\nmyself.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nVery natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, thank you.\\n\\nLANE.\\nThank you, sir. [Lane goes out.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nLane’s views on marriage seem somewhat lax. Really, if the lower orders\\ndon’t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They\\nseem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.\\n\\n[Enter Lane.]\\n\\nLANE.\\nMr. Ernest Worthing.\\n\\n[Enter Jack.]\\n\\n[Lane goes out_._]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nHow are you, my dear Ernest? What brings you up to town?\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, pleasure, pleasure! What else should bring one anywhere? Eating as\\nusual, I see, Algy!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Stiffly_._] I believe it is customary in good society to take some\\nslight refreshment at five o’clock. Where have you been since last\\nThursday?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Sitting down on the sofa.] In the country.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWhat on earth do you do there?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Pulling off his gloves_._] When one is in town one amuses oneself.\\nWhen one is in the country one amuses other people. It is excessively\\nboring.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nAnd who are the people you amuse?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Airily_._] Oh, neighbours, neighbours.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nGot nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?\\n\\nJACK.\\nPerfectly horrid! Never speak to one of them.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nHow immensely you must amuse them! [Goes over and takes sandwich.] By\\nthe way, Shropshire is your county, is it not?\\n\\nJACK.\\nEh? Shropshire? Yes, of course. Hallo! Why all these cups? Why cucumber\\nsandwiches? Why such reckless extravagance in one so young? Who is\\ncoming to tea?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOh! merely Aunt Augusta and Gwendolen.\\n\\nJACK.\\nHow perfectly delightful!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won’t quite\\napprove of your being here.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMay I ask why?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nMy dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly\\ndisgraceful. It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI am in love with Gwendolen. I have come up to town expressly to\\npropose to her.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI thought you had come up for pleasure? . . . I call that business.\\n\\nJACK.\\nHow utterly unromantic you are!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI really don’t see anything romantic in proposing. It is very romantic\\nto be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal.\\nWhy, one may be accepted. One usually is, I believe. Then the\\nexcitement is all over. The very essence of romance is uncertainty. If\\never I get married, I’ll certainly try to forget the fact.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI have no doubt about that, dear Algy. The Divorce Court was specially\\ninvented for people whose memories are so curiously constituted.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOh! there is no use speculating on that subject. Divorces are made in\\nHeaven—[Jack puts out his hand to take a sandwich. Algernon at once\\ninterferes.] Please don’t touch the cucumber sandwiches. They are\\nordered specially for Aunt Augusta. [Takes one and eats it.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, you have been eating them all the time.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThat is quite a different matter. She is my aunt. [Takes plate from\\nbelow.] Have some bread and butter. The bread and butter is for\\nGwendolen. Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Advancing to table and helping himself.] And very good bread and\\nbutter it is too.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to eat it\\nall. You behave as if you were married to her already. You are not\\nmarried to her already, and I don’t think you ever will be.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWhy on earth do you say that?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with.\\nGirls don’t think it right.\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, that is nonsense!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIt isn’t. It is a great truth. It accounts for the extraordinary number\\nof bachelors that one sees all over the place. In the second place, I\\ndon’t give my consent.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYour consent!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nMy dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin. And before I allow you to\\nmarry her, you will have to clear up the whole question of Cecily.\\n[Rings bell.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nCecily! What on earth do you mean? What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily! I\\ndon’t know any one of the name of Cecily.\\n\\n[Enter Lane.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing left in the smoking-room the\\nlast time he dined here.\\n\\nLANE.\\nYes, sir. [Lane goes out.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nDo you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time? I wish\\nto goodness you had let me know. I have been writing frantic letters to\\nScotland Yard about it. I was very nearly offering a large reward.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, I wish you would offer one. I happen to be more than usually hard\\nup.\\n\\nJACK.\\nThere is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is found.\\n\\n[Enter Lane with the cigarette case on a salver. Algernon takes it at\\nonce. Lane goes out.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say. [Opens case and\\nexamines it.] However, it makes no matter, for, now that I look at the\\ninscription inside, I find that the thing isn’t yours after all.\\n\\nJACK.\\nOf course it’s mine. [Moving to him.] You have seen me with it a\\nhundred times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written\\ninside. It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette\\ncase.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should\\nread and what one shouldn’t. More than half of modern culture depends\\non what one shouldn’t read.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI am quite aware of the fact, and I don’t propose to discuss modern\\nculture. It isn’t the sort of thing one should talk of in private. I\\nsimply want my cigarette case back.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes; but this isn’t your cigarette case. This cigarette case is a\\npresent from some one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn’t\\nknow any one of that name.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYour aunt!\\n\\nJACK.\\nYes. Charming old lady she is, too. Lives at Tunbridge Wells. Just give\\nit back to me, Algy.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Retreating to back of sofa.] But why does she call herself little\\nCecily if she is your aunt and lives at Tunbridge Wells? [Reading.]\\n‘From little Cecily with her fondest love.’\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Moving to sofa and kneeling upon it.] My dear fellow, what on earth is\\nthere in that? Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall. That is a\\nmatter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself. You\\nseem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt! That is\\nabsurd! For Heaven’s sake give me back my cigarette case. [Follows\\nAlgernon round the room.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle? ‘From little Cecily,\\nwith her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.’ There is no objection, I\\nadmit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no matter what\\nher size may be, should call her own nephew her uncle, I can’t quite\\nmake out. Besides, your name isn’t Jack at all; it is Ernest.\\n\\nJACK.\\nIt isn’t Ernest; it’s Jack.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYou have always told me it was Ernest. I have introduced you to every\\none as Ernest. You answer to the name of Ernest. You look as if your\\nname was Ernest. You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in\\nmy life. It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn’t\\nErnest. It’s on your cards. Here is one of them. [Taking it from case.]\\n‘Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany.’ I’ll keep this as a proof that\\nyour name is Ernest if ever you attempt to deny it to me, or to\\nGwendolen, or to any one else. [Puts the card in his pocket.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the\\ncigarette case was given to me in the country.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, but that does not account for the fact that your small Aunt\\nCecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle. Come,\\nold boy, you had much better have the thing out at once.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMy dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist. It is very\\nvulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn’t a dentist. It produces a\\nfalse impression.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, that is exactly what dentists always do. Now, go on! Tell me the\\nwhole thing. I may mention that I have always suspected you of being a\\nconfirmed and secret Bunburyist; and I am quite sure of it now.\\n\\nJACK.\\nBunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI’ll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as soon\\nas you are kind enough to inform me why you are Ernest in town and Jack\\nin the country.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, produce my cigarette case first.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nHere it is. [Hands cigarette case.] Now produce your explanation, and\\npray make it improbable. [Sits on sofa.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nMy dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at\\nall. In fact it’s perfectly ordinary. Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who\\nadopted me when I was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his\\ngrand-daughter, Miss Cecily Cardew. Cecily, who addresses me as her\\nuncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate,\\nlives at my place in the country under the charge of her admirable\\ngoverness, Miss Prism.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWhere is that place in the country, by the way?\\n\\nJACK.\\nThat is nothing to you, dear boy. You are not going to be invited . . .\\nI may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI suspected that, my dear fellow! I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire\\non two separate occasions. Now, go on. Why are you Ernest in town and\\nJack in the country?\\n\\nJACK.\\nMy dear Algy, I don’t know whether you will be able to understand my\\nreal motives. You are hardly serious enough. When one is placed in the\\nposition of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all\\nsubjects. It’s one’s duty to do so. And as a high moral tone can hardly\\nbe said to conduce very much to either one’s health or one’s happiness,\\nin order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger\\nbrother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into\\nthe most dreadful scrapes. That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure\\nand simple.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThe truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very\\ntedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete\\nimpossibility!\\n\\nJACK.\\nThat wouldn’t be at all a bad thing.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nLiterary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow. Don’t try it. You\\nshould leave that to people who haven’t been at a University. They do\\nit so well in the daily papers. What you really are is a Bunburyist. I\\nwas quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist. You are one of the\\nmost advanced Bunburyists I know.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWhat on earth do you mean?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYou have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, in order\\nthat you may be able to come up to town as often as you like. I have\\ninvented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that\\nI may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose. Bunbury is\\nperfectly invaluable. If it wasn’t for Bunbury’s extraordinary bad\\nhealth, for instance, I wouldn’t be able to dine with you at Willis’s\\nto-night, for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than\\na week.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI haven’t asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI know. You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations. It is\\nvery foolish of you. Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving\\ninvitations.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYou had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI haven’t the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind. To\\nbegin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to\\ndine with one’s own relations. In the second place, whenever I do dine\\nthere I am always treated as a member of the family, and sent down with\\neither no woman at all, or two. In the third place, I know perfectly\\nwell whom she will place me next to, to-night. She will place me next\\nMary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband across the\\ndinner-table. That is not very pleasant. Indeed, it is not even decent\\n. . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase. The amount\\nof women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly\\nscandalous. It looks so bad. It is simply washing one’s clean linen in\\npublic. Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I\\nnaturally want to talk to you about Bunburying. I want to tell you the\\nrules.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI’m not a Bunburyist at all. If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to\\nkill my brother, indeed I think I’ll kill him in any case. Cecily is a\\nlittle too much interested in him. It is rather a bore. So I am going\\nto get rid of Ernest. And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr.\\n. . . with your invalid friend who has the absurd name.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nNothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever get\\nmarried, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad\\nto know Bunbury. A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very\\ntedious time of it.\\n\\nJACK.\\nThat is nonsense. If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, and she is\\nthe only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, I certainly\\nwon’t want to know Bunbury.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThen your wife will. You don’t seem to realise, that in married life\\nthree is company and two is none.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Sententiously.] That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the\\ncorrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time.\\n\\nJACK.\\nFor heaven’s sake, don’t try to be cynical. It’s perfectly easy to be\\ncynical.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nMy dear fellow, it isn’t easy to be anything nowadays. There’s such a\\nlot of beastly competition about. [The sound of an electric bell is\\nheard.] Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta. Only relatives, or creditors,\\never ring in that Wagnerian manner. Now, if I get her out of the way\\nfor ten minutes, so that you can have an opportunity for proposing to\\nGwendolen, may I dine with you to-night at Willis’s?\\n\\nJACK.\\nI suppose so, if you want to.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, but you must be serious about it. I hate people who are not\\nserious about meals. It is so shallow of them.\\n\\n[Enter Lane.]\\n\\nLANE.\\nLady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.\\n\\n[Algernon goes forward to meet them. Enter Lady Bracknell and\\nGwendolen.]\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nGood afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving very well.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI’m feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThat’s not quite the same thing. In fact the two things rarely go\\ntogether. [Sees Jack and bows to him with icy coldness.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[To Gwendolen.] Dear me, you are smart!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI am always smart! Am I not, Mr. Worthing?\\n\\nJACK.\\nYou’re quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nOh! I hope I am not that. It would leave no room for developments, and\\nI intend to develop in many directions. [Gwendolen and Jack sit down\\ntogether in the corner.]\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nI’m sorry if we are a little late, Algernon, but I was obliged to call\\non dear Lady Harbury. I hadn’t been there since her poor husband’s\\ndeath. I never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty years\\nyounger. And now I’ll have a cup of tea, and one of those nice cucumber\\nsandwiches you promised me.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nCertainly, Aunt Augusta. [Goes over to tea-table.]\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nWon’t you come and sit here, Gwendolen?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nThanks, mamma, I’m quite comfortable where I am.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Picking up empty plate in horror.] Good heavens! Lane! Why are there\\nno cucumber sandwiches? I ordered them specially.\\n\\nLANE.\\n[Gravely.] There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir. I\\nwent down twice.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nNo cucumbers!\\n\\nLANE.\\nNo, sir. Not even for ready money.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThat will do, Lane, thank you.\\n\\nLANE.\\nThank you, sir. [Goes out.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no cucumbers,\\nnot even for ready money.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nIt really makes no matter, Algernon. I had some crumpets with Lady\\nHarbury, who seems to me to be living entirely for pleasure now.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nIt certainly has changed its colour. From what cause I, of course,\\ncannot say. [Algernon crosses and hands tea.] Thank you. I’ve quite a\\ntreat for you to-night, Algernon. I am going to send you down with Mary\\nFarquhar. She is such a nice woman, and so attentive to her husband.\\nIt’s delightful to watch them.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give up the pleasure of\\ndining with you to-night after all.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Frowning.] I hope not, Algernon. It would put my table completely out.\\nYour uncle would have to dine upstairs. Fortunately he is accustomed to\\nthat.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIt is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible disappointment\\nto me, but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say that my poor\\nfriend Bunbury is very ill again. [Exchanges glances with Jack.] They\\nseem to think I should be with him.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nIt is very strange. This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer from curiously bad\\nhealth.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nWell, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr.\\nBunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die. This\\nshilly-shallying with the question is absurd. Nor do I in any way\\napprove of the modern sympathy with invalids. I consider it morbid.\\nIllness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.\\nHealth is the primary duty of life. I am always telling that to your\\npoor uncle, but he never seems to take much notice . . . as far as any\\nimprovement in his ailment goes. I should be much obliged if you would\\nask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse on\\nSaturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me. It is my last\\nreception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation,\\nparticularly at the end of the season when every one has practically\\nsaid whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably not\\nmuch.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI’ll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious, and I\\nthink I can promise you he’ll be all right by Saturday. Of course the\\nmusic is a great difficulty. You see, if one plays good music, people\\ndon’t listen, and if one plays bad music people don’t talk. But I’ll\\nrun over the programme I’ve drawn out, if you will kindly come into the\\nnext room for a moment.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThank you, Algernon. It is very thoughtful of you. [Rising, and\\nfollowing Algernon.] I’m sure the programme will be delightful, after a\\nfew expurgations. French songs I cannot possibly allow. People always\\nseem to think that they are improper, and either look shocked, which is\\nvulgar, or laugh, which is worse. But German sounds a thoroughly\\nrespectable language, and indeed, I believe is so. Gwendolen, you will\\naccompany me.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nCertainly, mamma.\\n\\n[Lady Bracknell and Algernon go into the music-room, Gwendolen remains\\nbehind.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nCharming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nPray don’t talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing. Whenever people\\ntalk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain that they\\nmean something else. And that makes me so nervous.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI _do_ mean something else.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI thought so. In fact, I am never wrong.\\n\\nJACK.\\nAnd I would like to be allowed to take advantage of Lady Bracknell’s\\ntemporary absence . . .\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI would certainly advise you to do so. Mamma has a way of coming back\\nsuddenly into a room that I have often had to speak to her about.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Nervously.] Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you more\\nthan any girl . . . I have ever met since . . . I met you.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nYes, I am quite well aware of the fact. And I often wish that in\\npublic, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative. For me you have\\nalways had an irresistible fascination. Even before I met you I was far\\nfrom indifferent to you. [Jack looks at her in amazement.] We live, as\\nI hope you know, Mr. Worthing, in an age of ideals. The fact is\\nconstantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines, and has\\nreached the provincial pulpits, I am told; and my ideal has always been\\nto love some one of the name of Ernest. There is something in that name\\nthat inspires absolute confidence. The moment Algernon first mentioned\\nto me that he had a friend called Ernest, I knew I was destined to love\\nyou.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYou really love me, Gwendolen?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nPassionately!\\n\\nJACK.\\nDarling! You don’t know how happy you’ve made me.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nMy own Ernest!\\n\\nJACK.\\nBut you don’t really mean to say that you couldn’t love me if my name\\nwasn’t Ernest?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nBut your name is Ernest.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYes, I know it is. But supposing it was something else? Do you mean to\\nsay you couldn’t love me then?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Glibly.] Ah! that is clearly a metaphysical speculation, and like most\\nmetaphysical speculations has very little reference at all to the\\nactual facts of real life, as we know them.\\n\\nJACK.\\nPersonally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I don’t much care about\\nthe name of Ernest . . . I don’t think the name suits me at all.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nIt suits you perfectly. It is a divine name. It has a music of its own.\\nIt produces vibrations.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think there are lots of\\nother much nicer names. I think Jack, for instance, a charming name.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nJack? . . . No, there is very little music in the name Jack, if any at\\nall, indeed. It does not thrill. It produces absolutely no vibrations .\\n. . I have known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were\\nmore than usually plain. Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for\\nJohn! And I pity any woman who is married to a man called John. She\\nwould probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a\\nsingle moment’s solitude. The only really safe name is Ernest.\\n\\nJACK.\\nGwendolen, I must get christened at once—I mean we must get married at\\nonce. There is no time to be lost.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nMarried, Mr. Worthing?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Astounded.] Well . . . surely. You know that I love you, and you led\\nme to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you were not absolutely indifferent\\nto me.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI adore you. But you haven’t proposed to me yet. Nothing has been said\\nat all about marriage. The subject has not even been touched on.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell . . . may I propose to you now?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI think it would be an admirable opportunity. And to spare you any\\npossible disappointment, Mr. Worthing, I think it only fair to tell you\\nquite frankly before-hand that I am fully determined to accept you.\\n\\nJACK.\\nGwendolen!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nYes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say to me?\\n\\nJACK.\\nYou know what I have got to say to you.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nYes, but you don’t say it.\\n\\nJACK.\\nGwendolen, will you marry me? [Goes on his knees.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nOf course I will, darling. How long you have been about it! I am afraid\\nyou have had very little experience in how to propose.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMy own one, I have never loved any one in the world but you.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nYes, but men often propose for practice. I know my brother Gerald does.\\nAll my girl-friends tell me so. What wonderfully blue eyes you have,\\nErnest! They are quite, quite, blue. I hope you will always look at me\\njust like that, especially when there are other people present. [Enter\\nLady Bracknell.]\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nMr. Worthing! Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent posture. It is most\\nindecorous.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nMamma! [He tries to rise; she restrains him.] I must beg you to retire.\\nThis is no place for you. Besides, Mr. Worthing has not quite finished\\nyet.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nFinished what, may I ask?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma. [They rise together.]\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nPardon me, you are not engaged to any one. When you do become engaged\\nto some one, I, or your father, should his health permit him, will\\ninform you of the fact. An engagement should come on a young girl as a\\nsurprise, pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be. It is hardly a\\nmatter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself . . . And now I\\nhave a few questions to put to you, Mr. Worthing. While I am making\\nthese inquiries, you, Gwendolen, will wait for me below in the\\ncarriage.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Reproachfully.] Mamma!\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nIn the carriage, Gwendolen! [Gwendolen goes to the door. She and Jack\\nblow kisses to each other behind Lady Bracknell’s back. Lady Bracknell\\nlooks vaguely about as if she could not understand what the noise was.\\nFinally turns round.] Gwendolen, the carriage!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nYes, mamma. [Goes out, looking back at Jack.]\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Sitting down.] You can take a seat, Mr. Worthing.\\n\\n[Looks in her pocket for note-book and pencil.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nThank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Pencil and note-book in hand.] I feel bound to tell you that you are\\nnot down on my list of eligible young men, although I have the same\\nlist as the dear Duchess of Bolton has. We work together, in fact.\\nHowever, I am quite ready to enter your name, should your answers be\\nwhat a really affectionate mother requires. Do you smoke?\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, yes, I must admit I smoke.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nI am glad to hear it. A man should always have an occupation of some\\nkind. There are far too many idle men in London as it is. How old are\\nyou?\\n\\nJACK.\\nTwenty-nine.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nA very good age to be married at. I have always been of opinion that a\\nman who desires to get married should know either everything or\\nnothing. Which do you know?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[After some hesitation.] I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nI am pleased to hear it. I do not approve of anything that tampers with\\nnatural ignorance. Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it\\nand the bloom is gone. The whole theory of modern education is\\nradically unsound. Fortunately in England, at any rate, education\\nproduces no effect whatsoever. If it did, it would prove a serious\\ndanger to the upper classes, and probably lead to acts of violence in\\nGrosvenor Square. What is your income?\\n\\nJACK.\\nBetween seven and eight thousand a year.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Makes a note in her book.] In land, or in investments?\\n\\nJACK.\\nIn investments, chiefly.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThat is satisfactory. What between the duties expected of one during\\none’s lifetime, and the duties exacted from one after one’s death, land\\nhas ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure. It gives one position,\\nand prevents one from keeping it up. That’s all that can be said about\\nland.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI have a country house with some land, of course, attached to it, about\\nfifteen hundred acres, I believe; but I don’t depend on that for my\\nreal income. In fact, as far as I can make out, the poachers are the\\nonly people who make anything out of it.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nA country house! How many bedrooms? Well, that point can be cleared up\\nafterwards. You have a town house, I hope? A girl with a simple,\\nunspoiled nature, like Gwendolen, could hardly be expected to reside in\\nthe country.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it is let by the year to\\nLady Bloxham. Of course, I can get it back whenever I like, at six\\nmonths’ notice.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nLady Bloxham? I don’t know her.\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, she goes about very little. She is a lady considerably advanced in\\nyears.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nAh, nowadays that is no guarantee of respectability of character. What\\nnumber in Belgrave Square?\\n\\nJACK.\\n149.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Shaking her head.] The unfashionable side. I thought there was\\nsomething. However, that could easily be altered.\\n\\nJACK.\\nDo you mean the fashion, or the side?\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Sternly.] Both, if necessary, I presume. What are your politics?\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, I am afraid I really have none. I am a Liberal Unionist.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nOh, they count as Tories. They dine with us. Or come in the evening, at\\nany rate. Now to minor matters. Are your parents living?\\n\\nJACK.\\nI have lost both my parents.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nTo lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune; to\\nlose both looks like carelessness. Who was your father? He was\\nevidently a man of some wealth. Was he born in what the Radical papers\\ncall the purple of commerce, or did he rise from the ranks of the\\naristocracy?\\n\\nJACK.\\nI am afraid I really don’t know. The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I said I\\nhad lost my parents. It would be nearer the truth to say that my\\nparents seem to have lost me . . . I don’t actually know who I am by\\nbirth. I was . . . well, I was found.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nFound!\\n\\nJACK.\\nThe late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman of a very charitable and\\nkindly disposition, found me, and gave me the name of Worthing, because\\nhe happened to have a first-class ticket for Worthing in his pocket at\\nthe time. Worthing is a place in Sussex. It is a seaside resort.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nWhere did the charitable gentleman who had a first-class ticket for\\nthis seaside resort find you?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Gravely.] In a hand-bag.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nA hand-bag?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Very seriously.] Yes, Lady Bracknell. I was in a hand-bag—a somewhat\\nlarge, black leather hand-bag, with handles to it—an ordinary hand-bag\\nin fact.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nIn what locality did this Mr. James, or Thomas, Cardew come across this\\nordinary hand-bag?\\n\\nJACK.\\nIn the cloak-room at Victoria Station. It was given to him in mistake\\nfor his own.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThe cloak-room at Victoria Station?\\n\\nJACK.\\nYes. The Brighton line.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThe line is immaterial. Mr. Worthing, I confess I feel somewhat\\nbewildered by what you have just told me. To be born, or at any rate\\nbred, in a hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to\\ndisplay a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that\\nreminds one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution. And I\\npresume you know what that unfortunate movement led to? As for the\\nparticular locality in which the hand-bag was found, a cloak-room at a\\nrailway station might serve to conceal a social indiscretion—has\\nprobably, indeed, been used for that purpose before now—but it could\\nhardly be regarded as an assured basis for a recognised position in\\ngood society.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMay I ask you then what you would advise me to do? I need hardly say I\\nwould do anything in the world to ensure Gwendolen’s happiness.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nI would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing, to try and acquire some\\nrelations as soon as possible, and to make a definite effort to produce\\nat any rate one parent, of either sex, before the season is quite over.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, I don’t see how I could possibly manage to do that. I can produce\\nthe hand-bag at any moment. It is in my dressing-room at home. I really\\nthink that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nMe, sir! What has it to do with me? You can hardly imagine that I and\\nLord Bracknell would dream of allowing our only daughter—a girl brought\\nup with the utmost care—to marry into a cloak-room, and form an\\nalliance with a parcel? Good morning, Mr. Worthing!\\n\\n[Lady Bracknell sweeps out in majestic indignation.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nGood morning! [Algernon, from the other room, strikes up the Wedding\\nMarch. Jack looks perfectly furious, and goes to the door.] For\\ngoodness’ sake don’t play that ghastly tune, Algy. How idiotic you are!\\n\\n[The music stops and Algernon enters cheerily.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nDidn’t it go off all right, old boy? You don’t mean to say Gwendolen\\nrefused you? I know it is a way she has. She is always refusing people.\\nI think it is most ill-natured of her.\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, Gwendolen is as right as a trivet. As far as she is concerned, we\\nare engaged. Her mother is perfectly unbearable. Never met such a\\nGorgon . . . I don’t really know what a Gorgon is like, but I am quite\\nsure that Lady Bracknell is one. In any case, she is a monster, without\\nbeing a myth, which is rather unfair . . . I beg your pardon, Algy, I\\nsuppose I shouldn’t talk about your own aunt in that way before you.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nMy dear boy, I love hearing my relations abused. It is the only thing\\nthat makes me put up with them at all. Relations are simply a tedious\\npack of people, who haven’t got the remotest knowledge of how to live,\\nnor the smallest instinct about when to die.\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, that is nonsense!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIt isn’t!\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, I won’t argue about the matter. You always want to argue about\\nthings.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThat is exactly what things were originally made for.\\n\\nJACK.\\nUpon my word, if I thought that, I’d shoot myself . . . [A pause.] You\\ndon’t think there is any chance of Gwendolen becoming like her mother\\nin about a hundred and fifty years, do you, Algy?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nAll women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man\\ndoes. That’s his.\\n\\nJACK.\\nIs that clever?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIt is perfectly phrased! and quite as true as any observation in\\ncivilised life should be.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI am sick to death of cleverness. Everybody is clever nowadays. You\\ncan’t go anywhere without meeting clever people. The thing has become\\nan absolute public nuisance. I wish to goodness we had a few fools\\nleft.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWe have.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI should extremely like to meet them. What do they talk about?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThe fools? Oh! about the clever people, of course.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWhat fools!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBy the way, did you tell Gwendolen the truth about your being Ernest in\\ntown, and Jack in the country?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[In a very patronising manner.] My dear fellow, the truth isn’t quite\\nthe sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl. What\\nextraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThe only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her, if she is\\npretty, and to some one else, if she is plain.\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, that is nonsense.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWhat about your brother? What about the profligate Ernest?\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, before the end of the week I shall have got rid of him. I’ll say he\\ndied in Paris of apoplexy. Lots of people die of apoplexy, quite\\nsuddenly, don’t they?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, but it’s hereditary, my dear fellow. It’s a sort of thing that\\nruns in families. You had much better say a severe chill.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYou are sure a severe chill isn’t hereditary, or anything of that kind?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOf course it isn’t!\\n\\nJACK.\\nVery well, then. My poor brother Ernest is carried off suddenly, in\\nParis, by a severe chill. That gets rid of him.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBut I thought you said that . . . Miss Cardew was a little too much\\ninterested in your poor brother Ernest? Won’t she feel his loss a good\\ndeal?\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, that is all right. Cecily is not a silly romantic girl, I am glad\\nto say. She has got a capital appetite, goes long walks, and pays no\\nattention at all to her lessons.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI would rather like to see Cecily.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI will take very good care you never do. She is excessively pretty, and\\nshe is only just eighteen.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nHave you told Gwendolen yet that you have an excessively pretty ward\\nwho is only just eighteen?\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh! one doesn’t blurt these things out to people. Cecily and Gwendolen\\nare perfectly certain to be extremely great friends. I’ll bet you\\nanything you like that half an hour after they have met, they will be\\ncalling each other sister.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWomen only do that when they have called each other a lot of other\\nthings first. Now, my dear boy, if we want to get a good table at\\nWillis’s, we really must go and dress. Do you know it is nearly seven?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Irritably.] Oh! It always is nearly seven.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, I’m hungry.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI never knew you when you weren’t . . .\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWhat shall we do after dinner? Go to a theatre?\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh no! I loathe listening.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, let us go to the Club?\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, no! I hate talking.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, we might trot round to the Empire at ten?\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, no! I can’t bear looking at things. It is so silly.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, what shall we do?\\n\\nJACK.\\nNothing!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIt is awfully hard work doing nothing. However, I don’t mind hard work\\nwhere there is no definite object of any kind.\\n\\n[Enter Lane.]\\n\\nLANE.\\nMiss Fairfax.\\n\\n[Enter Gwendolen. Lane goes out.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nGwendolen, upon my word!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nAlgy, kindly turn your back. I have something very particular to say to\\nMr. Worthing.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nReally, Gwendolen, I don’t think I can allow this at all.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nAlgy, you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towards life. You\\nare not quite old enough to do that. [Algernon retires to the\\nfireplace.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nMy own darling!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nErnest, we may never be married. From the expression on mamma’s face I\\nfear we never shall. Few parents nowadays pay any regard to what their\\nchildren say to them. The old-fashioned respect for the young is fast\\ndying out. Whatever influence I ever had over mamma, I lost at the age\\nof three. But although she may prevent us from becoming man and wife,\\nand I may marry some one else, and marry often, nothing that she can\\npossibly do can alter my eternal devotion to you.\\n\\nJACK.\\nDear Gwendolen!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nThe story of your romantic origin, as related to me by mamma, with\\nunpleasing comments, has naturally stirred the deeper fibres of my\\nnature. Your Christian name has an irresistible fascination. The\\nsimplicity of your character makes you exquisitely incomprehensible to\\nme. Your town address at the Albany I have. What is your address in the\\ncountry?\\n\\nJACK.\\nThe Manor House, Woolton, Hertfordshire.\\n\\n[Algernon, who has been carefully listening, smiles to himself, and\\nwrites the address on his shirt-cuff. Then picks up the Railway Guide.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nThere is a good postal service, I suppose? It may be necessary to do\\nsomething desperate. That of course will require serious consideration.\\nI will communicate with you daily.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMy own one!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nHow long do you remain in town?\\n\\nJACK.\\nTill Monday.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nGood! Algy, you may turn round now.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThanks, I’ve turned round already.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nYou may also ring the bell.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYou will let me see you to your carriage, my own darling?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nCertainly.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[To Lane, who now enters.] I will see Miss Fairfax out.\\n\\nLANE.\\nYes, sir. [Jack and Gwendolen go off.]\\n\\n[Lane presents several letters on a salver to Algernon. It is to be\\nsurmised that they are bills, as Algernon, after looking at the\\nenvelopes, tears them up.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nA glass of sherry, Lane.\\n\\nLANE.\\nYes, sir.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nTo-morrow, Lane, I’m going Bunburying.\\n\\nLANE.\\nYes, sir.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI shall probably not be back till Monday. You can put up my dress\\nclothes, my smoking jacket, and all the Bunbury suits . . .\\n\\nLANE.\\nYes, sir. [Handing sherry.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI hope to-morrow will be a fine day, Lane.\\n\\nLANE.\\nIt never is, sir.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nLane, you’re a perfect pessimist.\\n\\nLANE.\\nI do my best to give satisfaction, sir.\\n\\n[Enter Jack. Lane goes off.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nThere’s a sensible, intellectual girl! the only girl I ever cared for\\nin my life. [Algernon is laughing immoderately.] What on earth are you\\nso amused at?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOh, I’m a little anxious about poor Bunbury, that is all.\\n\\nJACK.\\nIf you don’t take care, your friend Bunbury will get you into a serious\\nscrape some day.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI love scrapes. They are the only things that are never serious.\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, that’s nonsense, Algy. You never talk anything but nonsense.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nNobody ever does.\\n\\n[Jack looks indignantly at him, and leaves the room. Algernon lights a\\ncigarette, reads his shirt-cuff, and smiles.]\\n\\nACT DROP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSECOND ACT\\n\\n\\nSCENE\\n\\nGarden at the Manor House. A flight of grey stone steps leads up to the\\nhouse. The garden, an old-fashioned one, full of roses. Time of year,\\nJuly. Basket chairs, and a table covered with books, are set under a\\nlarge yew-tree.\\n\\n[Miss Prism discovered seated at the table. Cecily is at the back\\nwatering flowers.]\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Calling.] Cecily, Cecily! Surely such a utilitarian occupation as the\\nwatering of flowers is rather Moulton’s duty than yours? Especially at\\na moment when intellectual pleasures await you. Your German grammar is\\non the table. Pray open it at page fifteen. We will repeat yesterday’s\\nlesson.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Coming over very slowly.] But I don’t like German. It isn’t at all a\\nbecoming language. I know perfectly well that I look quite plain after\\nmy German lesson.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nChild, you know how anxious your guardian is that you should improve\\nyourself in every way. He laid particular stress on your German, as he\\nwas leaving for town yesterday. Indeed, he always lays stress on your\\nGerman when he is leaving for town.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nDear Uncle Jack is so very serious! Sometimes he is so serious that I\\nthink he cannot be quite well.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Drawing herself up.] Your guardian enjoys the best of health, and his\\ngravity of demeanour is especially to be commended in one so\\ncomparatively young as he is. I know no one who has a higher sense of\\nduty and responsibility.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI suppose that is why he often looks a little bored when we three are\\ntogether.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nCecily! I am surprised at you. Mr. Worthing has many troubles in his\\nlife. Idle merriment and triviality would be out of place in his\\nconversation. You must remember his constant anxiety about that\\nunfortunate young man his brother.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI wish Uncle Jack would allow that unfortunate young man, his brother,\\nto come down here sometimes. We might have a good influence over him,\\nMiss Prism. I am sure you certainly would. You know German, and\\ngeology, and things of that kind influence a man very much. [Cecily\\nbegins to write in her diary.]\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Shaking her head.] I do not think that even I could produce any effect\\non a character that according to his own brother’s admission is\\nirretrievably weak and vacillating. Indeed I am not sure that I would\\ndesire to reclaim him. I am not in favour of this modern mania for\\nturning bad people into good people at a moment’s notice. As a man sows\\nso let him reap. You must put away your diary, Cecily. I really don’t\\nsee why you should keep a diary at all.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my life. If I\\ndidn’t write them down, I should probably forget all about them.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nMemory, my dear Cecily, is the diary that we all carry about with us.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYes, but it usually chronicles the things that have never happened, and\\ncouldn’t possibly have happened. I believe that Memory is responsible\\nfor nearly all the three-volume novels that Mudie sends us.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nDo not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, Cecily. I wrote one\\nmyself in earlier days.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nDid you really, Miss Prism? How wonderfully clever you are! I hope it\\ndid not end happily? I don’t like novels that end happily. They depress\\nme so much.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nThe good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. That is what Fiction\\nmeans.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI suppose so. But it seems very unfair. And was your novel ever\\npublished?\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nAlas! no. The manuscript unfortunately was abandoned. [Cecily starts.]\\nI use the word in the sense of lost or mislaid. To your work, child,\\nthese speculations are profitless.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Smiling.] But I see dear Dr. Chasuble coming up through the garden.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Rising and advancing.] Dr. Chasuble! This is indeed a pleasure.\\n\\n[Enter Canon Chasuble.]\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nAnd how are we this morning? Miss Prism, you are, I trust, well?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nMiss Prism has just been complaining of a slight headache. I think it\\nwould do her so much good to have a short stroll with you in the Park,\\nDr. Chasuble.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nCecily, I have not mentioned anything about a headache.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nNo, dear Miss Prism, I know that, but I felt instinctively that you had\\na headache. Indeed I was thinking about that, and not about my German\\nlesson, when the Rector came in.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nI hope, Cecily, you are not inattentive.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh, I am afraid I am.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nThat is strange. Were I fortunate enough to be Miss Prism’s pupil, I\\nwould hang upon her lips. [Miss Prism glares.] I spoke\\nmetaphorically.—My metaphor was drawn from bees. Ahem! Mr. Worthing, I\\nsuppose, has not returned from town yet?\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nWe do not expect him till Monday afternoon.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nAh yes, he usually likes to spend his Sunday in London. He is not one\\nof those whose sole aim is enjoyment, as, by all accounts, that\\nunfortunate young man his brother seems to be. But I must not disturb\\nEgeria and her pupil any longer.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nEgeria? My name is Lætitia, Doctor.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\n[Bowing.] A classical allusion merely, drawn from the Pagan authors. I\\nshall see you both no doubt at Evensong?\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nI think, dear Doctor, I will have a stroll with you. I find I have a\\nheadache after all, and a walk might do it good.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nWith pleasure, Miss Prism, with pleasure. We might go as far as the\\nschools and back.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nThat would be delightful. Cecily, you will read your Political Economy\\nin my absence. The chapter on the Fall of the Rupee you may omit. It is\\nsomewhat too sensational. Even these metallic problems have their\\nmelodramatic side.\\n\\n[Goes down the garden with Dr. Chasuble.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Picks up books and throws them back on table.] Horrid Political\\nEconomy! Horrid Geography! Horrid, horrid German!\\n\\n[Enter Merriman with a card on a salver.]\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nMr. Ernest Worthing has just driven over from the station. He has\\nbrought his luggage with him.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Takes the card and reads it.] ‘Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany,\\nW.’ Uncle Jack’s brother! Did you tell him Mr. Worthing was in town?\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nYes, Miss. He seemed very much disappointed. I mentioned that you and\\nMiss Prism were in the garden. He said he was anxious to speak to you\\nprivately for a moment.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nAsk Mr. Ernest Worthing to come here. I suppose you had better talk to\\nthe housekeeper about a room for him.\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nYes, Miss.\\n\\n[Merriman goes off.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI have never met any really wicked person before. I feel rather\\nfrightened. I am so afraid he will look just like every one else.\\n\\n[Enter Algernon, very gay and debonnair.] He does!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Raising his hat.] You are my little cousin Cecily, I’m sure.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYou are under some strange mistake. I am not little. In fact, I believe\\nI am more than usually tall for my age. [Algernon is rather taken\\naback.] But I am your cousin Cecily. You, I see from your card, are\\nUncle Jack’s brother, my cousin Ernest, my wicked cousin Ernest.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOh! I am not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily. You mustn’t think\\nthat I am wicked.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nIf you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in a very\\ninexcusable manner. I hope you have not been leading a double life,\\npretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. That would\\nbe hypocrisy.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Looks at her in amazement.] Oh! Of course I have been rather reckless.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI am glad to hear it.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIn fact, now you mention the subject, I have been very bad in my own\\nsmall way.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI don’t think you should be so proud of that, though I am sure it must\\nhave been very pleasant.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIt is much pleasanter being here with you.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI can’t understand how you are here at all. Uncle Jack won’t be back\\ntill Monday afternoon.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThat is a great disappointment. I am obliged to go up by the first\\ntrain on Monday morning. I have a business appointment that I am\\nanxious . . . to miss?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nCouldn’t you miss it anywhere but in London?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nNo: the appointment is in London.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nWell, I know, of course, how important it is not to keep a business\\nengagement, if one wants to retain any sense of the beauty of life, but\\nstill I think you had better wait till Uncle Jack arrives. I know he\\nwants to speak to you about your emigrating.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nAbout my what?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYour emigrating. He has gone up to buy your outfit.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI certainly wouldn’t let Jack buy my outfit. He has no taste in\\nneckties at all.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI don’t think you will require neckties. Uncle Jack is sending you to\\nAustralia.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nAustralia! I’d sooner die.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nWell, he said at dinner on Wednesday night, that you would have to\\nchoose between this world, the next world, and Australia.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOh, well! The accounts I have received of Australia and the next world,\\nare not particularly encouraging. This world is good enough for me,\\ncousin Cecily.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYes, but are you good enough for it?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI’m afraid I’m not that. That is why I want you to reform me. You might\\nmake that your mission, if you don’t mind, cousin Cecily.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI’m afraid I’ve no time, this afternoon.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, would you mind my reforming myself this afternoon?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nIt is rather Quixotic of you. But I think you should try.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI will. I feel better already.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYou are looking a little worse.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThat is because I am hungry.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nHow thoughtless of me. I should have remembered that when one is going\\nto lead an entirely new life, one requires regular and wholesome meals.\\nWon’t you come in?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThank you. Might I have a buttonhole first? I never have any appetite\\nunless I have a buttonhole first.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nA Marechal Niel? [Picks up scissors.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nNo, I’d sooner have a pink rose.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nWhy? [Cuts a flower.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBecause you are like a pink rose, Cousin Cecily.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI don’t think it can be right for you to talk to me like that. Miss\\nPrism never says such things to me.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThen Miss Prism is a short-sighted old lady. [Cecily puts the rose in\\nhis buttonhole.] You are the prettiest girl I ever saw.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nMiss Prism says that all good looks are a snare.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThey are a snare that every sensible man would like to be caught in.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh, I don’t think I would care to catch a sensible man. I shouldn’t\\nknow what to talk to him about.\\n\\n[They pass into the house. Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble return.]\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nYou are too much alone, dear Dr. Chasuble. You should get married. A\\nmisanthrope I can understand—a womanthrope, never!\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\n[With a scholar’s shudder.] Believe me, I do not deserve so neologistic\\na phrase. The precept as well as the practice of the Primitive Church\\nwas distinctly against matrimony.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Sententiously.] That is obviously the reason why the Primitive Church\\nhas not lasted up to the present day. And you do not seem to realise,\\ndear Doctor, that by persistently remaining single, a man converts\\nhimself into a permanent public temptation. Men should be more careful;\\nthis very celibacy leads weaker vessels astray.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nBut is a man not equally attractive when married?\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nNo married man is ever attractive except to his wife.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nAnd often, I’ve been told, not even to her.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nThat depends on the intellectual sympathies of the woman. Maturity can\\nalways be depended on. Ripeness can be trusted. Young women are green.\\n[Dr. Chasuble starts.] I spoke horticulturally. My metaphor was drawn\\nfrom fruits. But where is Cecily?\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nPerhaps she followed us to the schools.\\n\\n[Enter Jack slowly from the back of the garden. He is dressed in the\\ndeepest mourning, with crape hatband and black gloves.]\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nMr. Worthing!\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nMr. Worthing?\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nThis is indeed a surprise. We did not look for you till Monday\\nafternoon.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Shakes Miss Prism’s hand in a tragic manner.] I have returned sooner\\nthan I expected. Dr. Chasuble, I hope you are well?\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nDear Mr. Worthing, I trust this garb of woe does not betoken some\\nterrible calamity?\\n\\nJACK.\\nMy brother.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nMore shameful debts and extravagance?\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nStill leading his life of pleasure?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Shaking his head.] Dead!\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nYour brother Ernest dead?\\n\\nJACK.\\nQuite dead.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nWhat a lesson for him! I trust he will profit by it.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nMr. Worthing, I offer you my sincere condolence. You have at least the\\nconsolation of knowing that you were always the most generous and\\nforgiving of brothers.\\n\\nJACK.\\nPoor Ernest! He had many faults, but it is a sad, sad blow.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nVery sad indeed. Were you with him at the end?\\n\\nJACK.\\nNo. He died abroad; in Paris, in fact. I had a telegram last night from\\nthe manager of the Grand Hotel.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nWas the cause of death mentioned?\\n\\nJACK.\\nA severe chill, it seems.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nAs a man sows, so shall he reap.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\n[Raising his hand.] Charity, dear Miss Prism, charity! None of us are\\nperfect. I myself am peculiarly susceptible to draughts. Will the\\ninterment take place here?\\n\\nJACK.\\nNo. He seems to have expressed a desire to be buried in Paris.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nIn Paris! [Shakes his head.] I fear that hardly points to any very\\nserious state of mind at the last. You would no doubt wish me to make\\nsome slight allusion to this tragic domestic affliction next Sunday.\\n[Jack presses his hand convulsively.] My sermon on the meaning of the\\nmanna in the wilderness can be adapted to almost any occasion, joyful,\\nor, as in the present case, distressing. [All sigh.] I have preached it\\nat harvest celebrations, christenings, confirmations, on days of\\nhumiliation and festal days. The last time I delivered it was in the\\nCathedral, as a charity sermon on behalf of the Society for the\\nPrevention of Discontent among the Upper Orders. The Bishop, who was\\npresent, was much struck by some of the analogies I drew.\\n\\nJACK.\\nAh! that reminds me, you mentioned christenings I think, Dr. Chasuble?\\nI suppose you know how to christen all right? [Dr. Chasuble looks\\nastounded.] I mean, of course, you are continually christening, aren’t\\nyou?\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nIt is, I regret to say, one of the Rector’s most constant duties in\\nthis parish. I have often spoken to the poorer classes on the subject.\\nBut they don’t seem to know what thrift is.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nBut is there any particular infant in whom you are interested, Mr.\\nWorthing? Your brother was, I believe, unmarried, was he not?\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh yes.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Bitterly.] People who live entirely for pleasure usually are.\\n\\nJACK.\\nBut it is not for any child, dear Doctor. I am very fond of children.\\nNo! the fact is, I would like to be christened myself, this afternoon,\\nif you have nothing better to do.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nBut surely, Mr. Worthing, you have been christened already?\\n\\nJACK.\\nI don’t remember anything about it.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nBut have you any grave doubts on the subject?\\n\\nJACK.\\nI certainly intend to have. Of course I don’t know if the thing would\\nbother you in any way, or if you think I am a little too old now.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nNot at all. The sprinkling, and, indeed, the immersion of adults is a\\nperfectly canonical practice.\\n\\nJACK.\\nImmersion!\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nYou need have no apprehensions. Sprinkling is all that is necessary, or\\nindeed I think advisable. Our weather is so changeable. At what hour\\nwould you wish the ceremony performed?\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, I might trot round about five if that would suit you.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nPerfectly, perfectly! In fact I have two similar ceremonies to perform\\nat that time. A case of twins that occurred recently in one of the\\noutlying cottages on your own estate. Poor Jenkins the carter, a most\\nhard-working man.\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh! I don’t see much fun in being christened along with other babies.\\nIt would be childish. Would half-past five do?\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nAdmirably! Admirably! [Takes out watch.] And now, dear Mr. Worthing, I\\nwill not intrude any longer into a house of sorrow. I would merely beg\\nyou not to be too much bowed down by grief. What seem to us bitter\\ntrials are often blessings in disguise.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nThis seems to me a blessing of an extremely obvious kind.\\n\\n[Enter Cecily from the house.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nUncle Jack! Oh, I am pleased to see you back. But what horrid clothes\\nyou have got on! Do go and change them.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nCecily!\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nMy child! my child! [Cecily goes towards Jack; he kisses her brow in a\\nmelancholy manner.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nWhat is the matter, Uncle Jack? Do look happy! You look as if you had\\ntoothache, and I have got such a surprise for you. Who do you think is\\nin the dining-room? Your brother!\\n\\nJACK.\\nWho?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYour brother Ernest. He arrived about half an hour ago.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWhat nonsense! I haven’t got a brother.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh, don’t say that. However badly he may have behaved to you in the\\npast he is still your brother. You couldn’t be so heartless as to\\ndisown him. I’ll tell him to come out. And you will shake hands with\\nhim, won’t you, Uncle Jack? [Runs back into the house.]\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nThese are very joyful tidings.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nAfter we had all been resigned to his loss, his sudden return seems to\\nme peculiarly distressing.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMy brother is in the dining-room? I don’t know what it all means. I\\nthink it is perfectly absurd.\\n\\n[Enter Algernon and Cecily hand in hand. They come slowly up to Jack.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nGood heavens! [Motions Algernon away.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBrother John, I have come down from town to tell you that I am very\\nsorry for all the trouble I have given you, and that I intend to lead a\\nbetter life in the future. [Jack glares at him and does not take his\\nhand.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nUncle Jack, you are not going to refuse your own brother’s hand?\\n\\nJACK.\\nNothing will induce me to take his hand. I think his coming down here\\ndisgraceful. He knows perfectly well why.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nUncle Jack, do be nice. There is some good in every one. Ernest has\\njust been telling me about his poor invalid friend Mr. Bunbury whom he\\ngoes to visit so often. And surely there must be much good in one who\\nis kind to an invalid, and leaves the pleasures of London to sit by a\\nbed of pain.\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh! he has been talking about Bunbury, has he?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYes, he has told me all about poor Mr. Bunbury, and his terrible state\\nof health.\\n\\nJACK.\\nBunbury! Well, I won’t have him talk to you about Bunbury or about\\nanything else. It is enough to drive one perfectly frantic.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOf course I admit that the faults were all on my side. But I must say\\nthat I think that Brother John’s coldness to me is peculiarly painful.\\nI expected a more enthusiastic welcome, especially considering it is\\nthe first time I have come here.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nUncle Jack, if you don’t shake hands with Ernest I will never forgive\\nyou.\\n\\nJACK.\\nNever forgive me?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nNever, never, never!\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, this is the last time I shall ever do it. [Shakes with Algernon\\nand glares.]\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nIt’s pleasant, is it not, to see so perfect a reconciliation? I think\\nwe might leave the two brothers together.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nCecily, you will come with us.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nCertainly, Miss Prism. My little task of reconciliation is over.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nYou have done a beautiful action to-day, dear child.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nWe must not be premature in our judgments.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI feel very happy. [They all go off except Jack and Algernon.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nYou young scoundrel, Algy, you must get out of this place as soon as\\npossible. I don’t allow any Bunburying here.\\n\\n[Enter Merriman.]\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nI have put Mr. Ernest’s things in the room next to yours, sir. I\\nsuppose that is all right?\\n\\nJACK.\\nWhat?\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nMr. Ernest’s luggage, sir. I have unpacked it and put it in the room\\nnext to your own.\\n\\nJACK.\\nHis luggage?\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nYes, sir. Three portmanteaus, a dressing-case, two hat-boxes, and a\\nlarge luncheon-basket.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI am afraid I can’t stay more than a week this time.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMerriman, order the dog-cart at once. Mr. Ernest has been suddenly\\ncalled back to town.\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nYes, sir. [Goes back into the house.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWhat a fearful liar you are, Jack. I have not been called back to town\\nat all.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYes, you have.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI haven’t heard any one call me.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYour duty as a gentleman calls you back.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nMy duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures in the\\nsmallest degree.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI can quite understand that.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, Cecily is a darling.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYou are not to talk of Miss Cardew like that. I don’t like it.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, I don’t like your clothes. You look perfectly ridiculous in them.\\nWhy on earth don’t you go up and change? It is perfectly childish to be\\nin deep mourning for a man who is actually staying for a whole week\\nwith you in your house as a guest. I call it grotesque.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYou are certainly not staying with me for a whole week as a guest or\\nanything else. You have got to leave . . . by the four-five train.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI certainly won’t leave you so long as you are in mourning. It would be\\nmost unfriendly. If I were in mourning you would stay with me, I\\nsuppose. I should think it very unkind if you didn’t.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, will you go if I change my clothes?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, if you are not too long. I never saw anybody take so long to\\ndress, and with such little result.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, at any rate, that is better than being always over-dressed as you\\nare.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIf I am occasionally a little over-dressed, I make up for it by being\\nalways immensely over-educated.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYour vanity is ridiculous, your conduct an outrage, and your presence\\nin my garden utterly absurd. However, you have got to catch the\\nfour-five, and I hope you will have a pleasant journey back to town.\\nThis Bunburying, as you call it, has not been a great success for you.\\n\\n[Goes into the house.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI think it has been a great success. I’m in love with Cecily, and that\\nis everything.\\n\\n[Enter Cecily at the back of the garden. She picks up the can and\\nbegins to water the flowers.] But I must see her before I go, and make\\narrangements for another Bunbury. Ah, there she is.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh, I merely came back to water the roses. I thought you were with\\nUncle Jack.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nHe’s gone to order the dog-cart for me.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh, is he going to take you for a nice drive?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nHe’s going to send me away.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nThen have we got to part?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI am afraid so. It’s a very painful parting.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nIt is always painful to part from people whom one has known for a very\\nbrief space of time. The absence of old friends one can endure with\\nequanimity. But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has\\njust been introduced is almost unbearable.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThank you.\\n\\n[Enter Merriman.]\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nThe dog-cart is at the door, sir. [Algernon looks appealingly at\\nCecily.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nIt can wait, Merriman for . . . five minutes.\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nYes, Miss. [Exit Merriman.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI hope, Cecily, I shall not offend you if I state quite frankly and\\nopenly that you seem to me to be in every way the visible\\npersonification of absolute perfection.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI think your frankness does you great credit, Ernest. If you will allow\\nme, I will copy your remarks into my diary. [Goes over to table and\\nbegins writing in diary.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nDo you really keep a diary? I’d give anything to look at it. May I?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh no. [Puts her hand over it.] You see, it is simply a very young\\ngirl’s record of her own thoughts and impressions, and consequently\\nmeant for publication. When it appears in volume form I hope you will\\norder a copy. But pray, Ernest, don’t stop. I delight in taking down\\nfrom dictation. I have reached ‘absolute perfection’. You can go on. I\\nam quite ready for more.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Somewhat taken aback.] Ahem! Ahem!\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh, don’t cough, Ernest. When one is dictating one should speak\\nfluently and not cough. Besides, I don’t know how to spell a cough.\\n[Writes as Algernon speaks.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Speaking very rapidly.] Cecily, ever since I first looked upon your\\nwonderful and incomparable beauty, I have dared to love you wildly,\\npassionately, devotedly, hopelessly.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI don’t think that you should tell me that you love me wildly,\\npassionately, devotedly, hopelessly. Hopelessly doesn’t seem to make\\nmuch sense, does it?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nCecily!\\n\\n[Enter Merriman.]\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nThe dog-cart is waiting, sir.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nTell it to come round next week, at the same hour.\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\n[Looks at Cecily, who makes no sign.] Yes, sir.\\n\\n[Merriman retires.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nUncle Jack would be very much annoyed if he knew you were staying on\\ntill next week, at the same hour.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOh, I don’t care about Jack. I don’t care for anybody in the whole\\nworld but you. I love you, Cecily. You will marry me, won’t you?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYou silly boy! Of course. Why, we have been engaged for the last three\\nmonths.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nFor the last three months?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYes, it will be exactly three months on Thursday.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBut how did we become engaged?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nWell, ever since dear Uncle Jack first confessed to us that he had a\\nyounger brother who was very wicked and bad, you of course have formed\\nthe chief topic of conversation between myself and Miss Prism. And of\\ncourse a man who is much talked about is always very attractive. One\\nfeels there must be something in him, after all. I daresay it was\\nfoolish of me, but I fell in love with you, Ernest.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nDarling! And when was the engagement actually settled?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOn the 14th of February last. Worn out by your entire ignorance of my\\nexistence, I determined to end the matter one way or the other, and\\nafter a long struggle with myself I accepted you under this dear old\\ntree here. The next day I bought this little ring in your name, and\\nthis is the little bangle with the true lover’s knot I promised you\\nalways to wear.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nDid I give you this? It’s very pretty, isn’t it?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYes, you’ve wonderfully good taste, Ernest. It’s the excuse I’ve always\\ngiven for your leading such a bad life. And this is the box in which I\\nkeep all your dear letters. [Kneels at table, opens box, and produces\\nletters tied up with blue ribbon.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nMy letters! But, my own sweet Cecily, I have never written you any\\nletters.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYou need hardly remind me of that, Ernest. I remember only too well\\nthat I was forced to write your letters for you. I wrote always three\\ntimes a week, and sometimes oftener.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOh, do let me read them, Cecily?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh, I couldn’t possibly. They would make you far too conceited.\\n[Replaces box.] The three you wrote me after I had broken off the\\nengagement are so beautiful, and so badly spelled, that even now I can\\nhardly read them without crying a little.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBut was our engagement ever broken off?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOf course it was. On the 22nd of last March. You can see the entry if\\nyou like. [Shows diary.] ‘To-day I broke off my engagement with Ernest.\\nI feel it is better to do so. The weather still continues charming.’\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBut why on earth did you break it off? What had I done? I had done\\nnothing at all. Cecily, I am very much hurt indeed to hear you broke it\\noff. Particularly when the weather was so charming.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nIt would hardly have been a really serious engagement if it hadn’t been\\nbroken off at least once. But I forgave you before the week was out.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Crossing to her, and kneeling.] What a perfect angel you are, Cecily.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYou dear romantic boy. [He kisses her, she puts her fingers through his\\nhair.] I hope your hair curls naturally, does it?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, darling, with a little help from others.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI am so glad.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYou’ll never break off our engagement again, Cecily?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI don’t think I could break it off now that I have actually met you.\\nBesides, of course, there is the question of your name.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, of course. [Nervously.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYou must not laugh at me, darling, but it had always been a girlish\\ndream of mine to love some one whose name was Ernest. [Algernon rises,\\nCecily also.] There is something in that name that seems to inspire\\nabsolute confidence. I pity any poor married woman whose husband is not\\ncalled Ernest.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBut, my dear child, do you mean to say you could not love me if I had\\nsome other name?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nBut what name?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOh, any name you like—Algernon—for instance . . .\\n\\nCECILY.\\nBut I don’t like the name of Algernon.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, my own dear, sweet, loving little darling, I really can’t see why\\nyou should object to the name of Algernon. It is not at all a bad name.\\nIn fact, it is rather an aristocratic name. Half of the chaps who get\\ninto the Bankruptcy Court are called Algernon. But seriously, Cecily .\\n. . [Moving to her] . . . if my name was Algy, couldn’t you love me?\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Rising.] I might respect you, Ernest, I might admire your character,\\nbut I fear that I should not be able to give you my undivided\\nattention.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nAhem! Cecily! [Picking up hat.] Your Rector here is, I suppose,\\nthoroughly experienced in the practice of all the rites and ceremonials\\nof the Church?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh, yes. Dr. Chasuble is a most learned man. He has never written a\\nsingle book, so you can imagine how much he knows.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI must see him at once on a most important christening—I mean on most\\nimportant business.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI shan’t be away more than half an hour.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nConsidering that we have been engaged since February the 14th, and that\\nI only met you to-day for the first time, I think it is rather hard\\nthat you should leave me for so long a period as half an hour. Couldn’t\\nyou make it twenty minutes?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI’ll be back in no time.\\n\\n[Kisses her and rushes down the garden.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nWhat an impetuous boy he is! I like his hair so much. I must enter his\\nproposal in my diary.\\n\\n[Enter Merriman.]\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nA Miss Fairfax has just called to see Mr. Worthing. On very important\\nbusiness, Miss Fairfax states.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nIsn’t Mr. Worthing in his library?\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nMr. Worthing went over in the direction of the Rectory some time ago.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nPray ask the lady to come out here; Mr. Worthing is sure to be back\\nsoon. And you can bring tea.\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nYes, Miss. [Goes out.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nMiss Fairfax! I suppose one of the many good elderly women who are\\nassociated with Uncle Jack in some of his philanthropic work in London.\\nI don’t quite like women who are interested in philanthropic work. I\\nthink it is so forward of them.\\n\\n[Enter Merriman.]\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nMiss Fairfax.\\n\\n[Enter Gwendolen.]\\n\\n[Exit Merriman.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Advancing to meet her.] Pray let me introduce myself to you. My name\\nis Cecily Cardew.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nCecily Cardew? [Moving to her and shaking hands.] What a very sweet\\nname! Something tells me that we are going to be great friends. I like\\nyou already more than I can say. My first impressions of people are\\nnever wrong.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nHow nice of you to like me so much after we have known each other such\\na comparatively short time. Pray sit down.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Still standing up.] I may call you Cecily, may I not?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nWith pleasure!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nAnd you will always call me Gwendolen, won’t you?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nIf you wish.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nThen that is all quite settled, is it not?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI hope so. [A pause. They both sit down together.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nPerhaps this might be a favourable opportunity for my mentioning who I\\nam. My father is Lord Bracknell. You have never heard of papa, I\\nsuppose?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI don’t think so.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nOutside the family circle, papa, I am glad to say, is entirely unknown.\\nI think that is quite as it should be. The home seems to me to be the\\nproper sphere for the man. And certainly once a man begins to neglect\\nhis domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate, does he not? And I\\ndon’t like that. It makes men so very attractive. Cecily, mamma, whose\\nviews on education are remarkably strict, has brought me up to be\\nextremely short-sighted; it is part of her system; so do you mind my\\nlooking at you through my glasses?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh! not at all, Gwendolen. I am very fond of being looked at.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[After examining Cecily carefully through a lorgnette.] You are here on\\na short visit, I suppose.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh no! I live here.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Severely.] Really? Your mother, no doubt, or some female relative of\\nadvanced years, resides here also?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh no! I have no mother, nor, in fact, any relations.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nIndeed?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nMy dear guardian, with the assistance of Miss Prism, has the arduous\\ntask of looking after me.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nYour guardian?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYes, I am Mr. Worthing’s ward.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nOh! It is strange he never mentioned to me that he had a ward. How\\nsecretive of him! He grows more interesting hourly. I am not sure,\\nhowever, that the news inspires me with feelings of unmixed delight.\\n[Rising and going to her.] I am very fond of you, Cecily; I have liked\\nyou ever since I met you! But I am bound to state that now that I know\\nthat you are Mr. Worthing’s ward, I cannot help expressing a wish you\\nwere—well, just a little older than you seem to be—and not quite so\\nvery alluring in appearance. In fact, if I may speak candidly—\\n\\nCECILY.\\nPray do! I think that whenever one has anything unpleasant to say, one\\nshould always be quite candid.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nWell, to speak with perfect candour, Cecily, I wish that you were fully\\nforty-two, and more than usually plain for your age. Ernest has a\\nstrong upright nature. He is the very soul of truth and honour.\\nDisloyalty would be as impossible to him as deception. But even men of\\nthe noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to the\\ninfluence of the physical charms of others. Modern, no less than\\nAncient History, supplies us with many most painful examples of what I\\nrefer to. If it were not so, indeed, History would be quite unreadable.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI beg your pardon, Gwendolen, did you say Ernest?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nYes.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh, but it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is my guardian. It is his\\nbrother—his elder brother.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Sitting down again.] Ernest never mentioned to me that he had a\\nbrother.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI am sorry to say they have not been on good terms for a long time.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nAh! that accounts for it. And now that I think of it I have never heard\\nany man mention his brother. The subject seems distasteful to most men.\\nCecily, you have lifted a load from my mind. I was growing almost\\nanxious. It would have been terrible if any cloud had come across a\\nfriendship like ours, would it not? Of course you are quite, quite sure\\nthat it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is your guardian?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nQuite sure. [A pause.] In fact, I am going to be his.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Inquiringly.] I beg your pardon?\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Rather shy and confidingly.] Dearest Gwendolen, there is no reason why\\nI should make a secret of it to you. Our little county newspaper is\\nsure to chronicle the fact next week. Mr. Ernest Worthing and I are\\nengaged to be married.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Quite politely, rising.] My darling Cecily, I think there must be some\\nslight error. Mr. Ernest Worthing is engaged to me. The announcement\\nwill appear in the _Morning Post_ on Saturday at the latest.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Very politely, rising.] I am afraid you must be under some\\nmisconception. Ernest proposed to me exactly ten minutes ago. [Shows\\ndiary.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Examines diary through her lorgnettte carefully.] It is certainly very\\ncurious, for he asked me to be his wife yesterday afternoon at 5.30. If\\nyou would care to verify the incident, pray do so. [Produces diary of\\nher own.] I never travel without my diary. One should always have\\nsomething sensational to read in the train. I am so sorry, dear Cecily,\\nif it is any disappointment to you, but I am afraid I have the prior\\nclaim.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nIt would distress me more than I can tell you, dear Gwendolen, if it\\ncaused you any mental or physical anguish, but I feel bound to point\\nout that since Ernest proposed to you he clearly has changed his mind.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Meditatively.] If the poor fellow has been entrapped into any foolish\\npromise I shall consider it my duty to rescue him at once, and with a\\nfirm hand.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Thoughtfully and sadly.] Whatever unfortunate entanglement my dear boy\\nmay have got into, I will never reproach him with it after we are\\nmarried.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nDo you allude to me, Miss Cardew, as an entanglement? You are\\npresumptuous. On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral\\nduty to speak one’s mind. It becomes a pleasure.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nDo you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that I entrapped Ernest into an\\nengagement? How dare you? This is no time for wearing the shallow mask\\nof manners. When I see a spade I call it a spade.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Satirically.] I am glad to say that I have never seen a spade. It is\\nobvious that our social spheres have been widely different.\\n\\n[Enter Merriman, followed by the footman. He carries a salver, table\\ncloth, and plate stand. Cecily is about to retort. The presence of the\\nservants exercises a restraining influence, under which both girls\\nchafe.]\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nShall I lay tea here as usual, Miss?\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Sternly, in a calm voice.] Yes, as usual. [Merriman begins to clear\\ntable and lay cloth. A long pause. Cecily and Gwendolen glare at each\\nother.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nAre there many interesting walks in the vicinity, Miss Cardew?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh! yes! a great many. From the top of one of the hills quite close one\\ncan see five counties.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nFive counties! I don’t think I should like that; I hate crowds.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Sweetly.] I suppose that is why you live in town? [Gwendolen bites her\\nlip, and beats her foot nervously with her parasol.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Looking round.] Quite a well-kept garden this is, Miss Cardew.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nSo glad you like it, Miss Fairfax.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI had no idea there were any flowers in the country.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh, flowers are as common here, Miss Fairfax, as people are in London.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nPersonally I cannot understand how anybody manages to exist in the\\ncountry, if anybody who is anybody does. The country always bores me to\\ndeath.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nAh! This is what the newspapers call agricultural depression, is it\\nnot? I believe the aristocracy are suffering very much from it just at\\npresent. It is almost an epidemic amongst them, I have been told. May I\\noffer you some tea, Miss Fairfax?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[With elaborate politeness.] Thank you. [Aside.] Detestable girl! But I\\nrequire tea!\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Sweetly.] Sugar?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Superciliously.] No, thank you. Sugar is not fashionable any more.\\n[Cecily looks angrily at her, takes up the tongs and puts four lumps of\\nsugar into the cup.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Severely.] Cake or bread and butter?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[In a bored manner.] Bread and butter, please. Cake is rarely seen at\\nthe best houses nowadays.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Cuts a very large slice of cake, and puts it on the tray.] Hand that\\nto Miss Fairfax.\\n\\n[Merriman does so, and goes out with footman. Gwendolen drinks the tea\\nand makes a grimace. Puts down cup at once, reaches out her hand to the\\nbread and butter, looks at it, and finds it is cake. Rises in\\nindignation.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nYou have filled my tea with lumps of sugar, and though I asked most\\ndistinctly for bread and butter, you have given me cake. I am known for\\nthe gentleness of my disposition, and the extraordinary sweetness of my\\nnature, but I warn you, Miss Cardew, you may go too far.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Rising.] To save my poor, innocent, trusting boy from the machinations\\nof any other girl there are no lengths to which I would not go.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nFrom the moment I saw you I distrusted you. I felt that you were false\\nand deceitful. I am never deceived in such matters. My first\\nimpressions of people are invariably right.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nIt seems to me, Miss Fairfax, that I am trespassing on your valuable\\ntime. No doubt you have many other calls of a similar character to make\\nin the neighbourhood.\\n\\n[Enter Jack.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Catching sight of him.] Ernest! My own Ernest!\\n\\nJACK.\\nGwendolen! Darling! [Offers to kiss her.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Draws back.] A moment! May I ask if you are engaged to be married to\\nthis young lady? [Points to Cecily.]\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Laughing.] To dear little Cecily! Of course not! What could have put\\nsuch an idea into your pretty little head?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nThank you. You may! [Offers her cheek.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Very sweetly.] I knew there must be some misunderstanding, Miss\\nFairfax. The gentleman whose arm is at present round your waist is my\\nguardian, Mr. John Worthing.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI beg your pardon?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nThis is Uncle Jack.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Receding.] Jack! Oh!\\n\\n[Enter Algernon.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nHere is Ernest.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Goes straight over to Cecily without noticing any one else.] My own\\nlove! [Offers to kiss her.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Drawing back.] A moment, Ernest! May I ask you—are you engaged to be\\nmarried to this young lady?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Looking round.] To what young lady? Good heavens! Gwendolen!\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYes! to good heavens, Gwendolen, I mean to Gwendolen.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Laughing.] Of course not! What could have put such an idea into your\\npretty little head?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nThank you. [Presenting her cheek to be kissed.] You may. [Algernon\\nkisses her.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI felt there was some slight error, Miss Cardew. The gentleman who is\\nnow embracing you is my cousin, Mr. Algernon Moncrieff.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Breaking away from Algernon.] Algernon Moncrieff! Oh! [The two girls\\nmove towards each other and put their arms round each other’s waists as\\nif for protection.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nAre you called Algernon?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI cannot deny it.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nIs your name really John?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Standing rather proudly.] I could deny it if I liked. I could deny\\nanything if I liked. But my name certainly is John. It has been John\\nfor years.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[To Gwendolen.] A gross deception has been practised on both of us.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nMy poor wounded Cecily!\\n\\nCECILY.\\nMy sweet wronged Gwendolen!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Slowly and seriously.] You will call me sister, will you not? [They\\nembrace. Jack and Algernon groan and walk up and down.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Rather brightly.] There is just one question I would like to be\\nallowed to ask my guardian.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nAn admirable idea! Mr. Worthing, there is just one question I would\\nlike to be permitted to put to you. Where is your brother Ernest? We\\nare both engaged to be married to your brother Ernest, so it is a\\nmatter of some importance to us to know where your brother Ernest is at\\npresent.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Slowly and hesitatingly.] Gwendolen—Cecily—it is very painful for me\\nto be forced to speak the truth. It is the first time in my life that I\\nhave ever been reduced to such a painful position, and I am really\\nquite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind. However, I will tell\\nyou quite frankly that I have no brother Ernest. I have no brother at\\nall. I never had a brother in my life, and I certainly have not the\\nsmallest intention of ever having one in the future.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Surprised.] No brother at all?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Cheerily.] None!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Severely.] Had you never a brother of any kind?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Pleasantly.] Never. Not even of any kind.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI am afraid it is quite clear, Cecily, that neither of us is engaged to\\nbe married to any one.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nIt is not a very pleasant position for a young girl suddenly to find\\nherself in. Is it?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nLet us go into the house. They will hardly venture to come after us\\nthere.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nNo, men are so cowardly, aren’t they?\\n\\n[They retire into the house with scornful looks.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nThis ghastly state of things is what you call Bunburying, I suppose?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, and a perfectly wonderful Bunbury it is. The most wonderful\\nBunbury I have ever had in my life.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, you’ve no right whatsoever to Bunbury here.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThat is absurd. One has a right to Bunbury anywhere one chooses. Every\\nserious Bunburyist knows that.\\n\\nJACK.\\nSerious Bunburyist! Good heavens!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, one must be serious about something, if one wants to have any\\namusement in life. I happen to be serious about Bunburying. What on\\nearth you are serious about I haven’t got the remotest idea. About\\neverything, I should fancy. You have such an absolutely trivial nature.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, the only small satisfaction I have in the whole of this wretched\\nbusiness is that your friend Bunbury is quite exploded. You won’t be\\nable to run down to the country quite so often as you used to do, dear\\nAlgy. And a very good thing too.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYour brother is a little off colour, isn’t he, dear Jack? You won’t be\\nable to disappear to London quite so frequently as your wicked custom\\nwas. And not a bad thing either.\\n\\nJACK.\\nAs for your conduct towards Miss Cardew, I must say that your taking in\\na sweet, simple, innocent girl like that is quite inexcusable. To say\\nnothing of the fact that she is my ward.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI can see no possible defence at all for your deceiving a brilliant,\\nclever, thoroughly experienced young lady like Miss Fairfax. To say\\nnothing of the fact that she is my cousin.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI wanted to be engaged to Gwendolen, that is all. I love her.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, I simply wanted to be engaged to Cecily. I adore her.\\n\\nJACK.\\nThere is certainly no chance of your marrying Miss Cardew.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI don’t think there is much likelihood, Jack, of you and Miss Fairfax\\nbeing united.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, that is no business of yours.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIf it was my business, I wouldn’t talk about it. [Begins to eat\\nmuffins.] It is very vulgar to talk about one’s business. Only people\\nlike stock-brokers do that, and then merely at dinner parties.\\n\\nJACK.\\nHow can you sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in this\\nhorrible trouble, I can’t make out. You seem to me to be perfectly\\nheartless.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, I can’t eat muffins in an agitated manner. The butter would\\nprobably get on my cuffs. One should always eat muffins quite calmly.\\nIt is the only way to eat them.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI say it’s perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all, under the\\ncircumstances.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWhen I am in trouble, eating is the only thing that consoles me.\\nIndeed, when I am in really great trouble, as any one who knows me\\nintimately will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink. At\\nthe present moment I am eating muffins because I am unhappy. Besides, I\\nam particularly fond of muffins. [Rising.]\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Rising.] Well, that is no reason why you should eat them all in that\\ngreedy way. [Takes muffins from Algernon.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Offering tea-cake.] I wish you would have tea-cake instead. I don’t\\nlike tea-cake.\\n\\nJACK.\\nGood heavens! I suppose a man may eat his own muffins in his own\\ngarden.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBut you have just said it was perfectly heartless to eat muffins.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI said it was perfectly heartless of you, under the circumstances. That\\nis a very different thing.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThat may be. But the muffins are the same. [He seizes the muffin-dish\\nfrom Jack.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nAlgy, I wish to goodness you would go.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYou can’t possibly ask me to go without having some dinner. It’s\\nabsurd. I never go without my dinner. No one ever does, except\\nvegetarians and people like that. Besides I have just made arrangements\\nwith Dr. Chasuble to be christened at a quarter to six under the name\\nof Ernest.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMy dear fellow, the sooner you give up that nonsense the better. I made\\narrangements this morning with Dr. Chasuble to be christened myself at\\n5.30, and I naturally will take the name of Ernest. Gwendolen would\\nwish it. We can’t both be christened Ernest. It’s absurd. Besides, I\\nhave a perfect right to be christened if I like. There is no evidence\\nat all that I have ever been christened by anybody. I should think it\\nextremely probable I never was, and so does Dr. Chasuble. It is\\nentirely different in your case. You have been christened already.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, but I have not been christened for years.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYes, but you have been christened. That is the important thing.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nQuite so. So I know my constitution can stand it. If you are not quite\\nsure about your ever having been christened, I must say I think it\\nrather dangerous your venturing on it now. It might make you very\\nunwell. You can hardly have forgotten that some one very closely\\nconnected with you was very nearly carried off this week in Paris by a\\nsevere chill.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYes, but you said yourself that a severe chill was not hereditary.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIt usen’t to be, I know—but I daresay it is now. Science is always\\nmaking wonderful improvements in things.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Picking up the muffin-dish.] Oh, that is nonsense; you are always\\ntalking nonsense.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nJack, you are at the muffins again! I wish you wouldn’t. There are only\\ntwo left. [Takes them.] I told you I was particularly fond of muffins.\\n\\nJACK.\\nBut I hate tea-cake.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWhy on earth then do you allow tea-cake to be served up for your\\nguests? What ideas you have of hospitality!\\n\\nJACK.\\nAlgernon! I have already told you to go. I don’t want you here. Why\\ndon’t you go!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI haven’t quite finished my tea yet! and there is still one muffin\\nleft. [Jack groans, and sinks into a chair. Algernon still continues\\neating.]\\n\\nACT DROP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHIRD ACT\\n\\nSCENE\\n\\nMorning-room at the Manor House.\\n\\n[Gwendolen and Cecily are at the window, looking out into the garden.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nThe fact that they did not follow us at once into the house, as any one\\nelse would have done, seems to me to show that they have some sense of\\nshame left.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nThey have been eating muffins. That looks like repentance.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[After a pause.] They don’t seem to notice us at all. Couldn’t you\\ncough?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nBut I haven’t got a cough.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nThey’re looking at us. What effrontery!\\n\\nCECILY.\\nThey’re approaching. That’s very forward of them.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nLet us preserve a dignified silence.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nCertainly. It’s the only thing to do now. [Enter Jack followed by\\nAlgernon. They whistle some dreadful popular air from a British Opera.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nThis dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nA most distasteful one.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nBut we will not be the first to speak.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nMr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you. Much depends\\non your reply.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nGwendolen, your common sense is invaluable. Mr. Moncrieff, kindly\\nanswer me the following question. Why did you pretend to be my\\nguardian’s brother?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIn order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[To Gwendolen.] That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does\\nit not?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nYes, dear, if you can believe him.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI don’t. But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his answer.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nTrue. In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital\\nthing. Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me for\\npretending to have a brother? Was it in order that you might have an\\nopportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?\\n\\nJACK.\\nCan you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI have the gravest doubts upon the subject. But I intend to crush them.\\nThis is not the moment for German scepticism. [Moving to Cecily.] Their\\nexplanations appear to be quite satisfactory, especially Mr.\\nWorthing’s. That seems to me to have the stamp of truth upon it.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said. His voice alone\\ninspires one with absolute credulity.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nThen you think we should forgive them?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYes. I mean no.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nTrue! I had forgotten. There are principles at stake that one cannot\\nsurrender. Which of us should tell them? The task is not a pleasant\\none.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nCould we not both speak at the same time?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nAn excellent idea! I nearly always speak at the same time as other\\npeople. Will you take the time from me?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nCertainly. [Gwendolen beats time with uplifted finger.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN and CECILY [Speaking together.] Your Christian names are\\nstill an insuperable barrier. That is all!\\n\\nJACK and ALGERNON [Speaking together.] Our Christian names! Is that\\nall? But we are going to be christened this afternoon.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[To Jack.] For my sake you are prepared to do this terrible thing?\\n\\nJACK.\\nI am.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[To Algernon.] To please me you are ready to face this fearful ordeal?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI am!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nHow absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes! Where questions of\\nself-sacrifice are concerned, men are infinitely beyond us.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWe are. [Clasps hands with Algernon.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nThey have moments of physical courage of which we women know absolutely\\nnothing.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[To Jack.] Darling!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[To Cecily.] Darling! [They fall into each other’s arms.]\\n\\n[Enter Merriman. When he enters he coughs loudly, seeing the\\nsituation.]\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nAhem! Ahem! Lady Bracknell!\\n\\nJACK.\\nGood heavens!\\n\\n[Enter Lady Bracknell. The couples separate in alarm. Exit Merriman.]\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nGwendolen! What does this mean?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nMerely that I am engaged to be married to Mr. Worthing, mamma.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nCome here. Sit down. Sit down immediately. Hesitation of any kind is a\\nsign of mental decay in the young, of physical weakness in the old.\\n[Turns to Jack.] Apprised, sir, of my daughter’s sudden flight by her\\ntrusty maid, whose confidence I purchased by means of a small coin, I\\nfollowed her at once by a luggage train. Her unhappy father is, I am\\nglad to say, under the impression that she is attending a more than\\nusually lengthy lecture by the University Extension Scheme on the\\nInfluence of a permanent income on Thought. I do not propose to\\nundeceive him. Indeed I have never undeceived him on any question. I\\nwould consider it wrong. But of course, you will clearly understand\\nthat all communication between yourself and my daughter must cease\\nimmediately from this moment. On this point, as indeed on all points, I\\nam firm.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI am engaged to be married to Gwendolen, Lady Bracknell!\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nYou are nothing of the kind, sir. And now, as regards Algernon! . . .\\nAlgernon!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, Aunt Augusta.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nMay I ask if it is in this house that your invalid friend Mr. Bunbury\\nresides?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Stammering.] Oh! No! Bunbury doesn’t live here. Bunbury is somewhere\\nelse at present. In fact, Bunbury is dead.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nDead! When did Mr. Bunbury die? His death must have been extremely\\nsudden.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Airily.] Oh! I killed Bunbury this afternoon. I mean poor Bunbury died\\nthis afternoon.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nWhat did he die of?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBunbury? Oh, he was quite exploded.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nExploded! Was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage? I was not aware\\nthat Mr. Bunbury was interested in social legislation. If so, he is\\nwell punished for his morbidity.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nMy dear Aunt Augusta, I mean he was found out! The doctors found out\\nthat Bunbury could not live, that is what I mean—so Bunbury died.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nHe seems to have had great confidence in the opinion of his physicians.\\nI am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the last to some\\ndefinite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice. And\\nnow that we have finally got rid of this Mr. Bunbury, may I ask, Mr.\\nWorthing, who is that young person whose hand my nephew Algernon is now\\nholding in what seems to me a peculiarly unnecessary manner?\\n\\nJACK.\\nThat lady is Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward. [Lady Bracknell bows coldly\\nto Cecily.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI am engaged to be married to Cecily, Aunt Augusta.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nI beg your pardon?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nMr. Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[With a shiver, crossing to the sofa and sitting down.] I do not know\\nwhether there is anything peculiarly exciting in the air of this\\nparticular part of Hertfordshire, but the number of engagements that go\\non seems to me considerably above the proper average that statistics\\nhave laid down for our guidance. I think some preliminary inquiry on my\\npart would not be out of place. Mr. Worthing, is Miss Cardew at all\\nconnected with any of the larger railway stations in London? I merely\\ndesire information. Until yesterday I had no idea that there were any\\nfamilies or persons whose origin was a Terminus. [Jack looks perfectly\\nfurious, but restrains himself.]\\n\\nJACK.\\n[In a clear, cold voice.] Miss Cardew is the grand-daughter of the late\\nMr. Thomas Cardew of 149 Belgrave Square, S.W.; Gervase Park, Dorking,\\nSurrey; and the Sporran, Fifeshire, N.B.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThat sounds not unsatisfactory. Three addresses always inspire\\nconfidence, even in tradesmen. But what proof have I of their\\nauthenticity?\\n\\nJACK.\\nI have carefully preserved the Court Guides of the period. They are\\nopen to your inspection, Lady Bracknell.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Grimly.] I have known strange errors in that publication.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMiss Cardew’s family solicitors are Messrs. Markby, Markby, and Markby.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nMarkby, Markby, and Markby? A firm of the very highest position in\\ntheir profession. Indeed I am told that one of the Mr. Markby’s is\\noccasionally to be seen at dinner parties. So far I am satisfied.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Very irritably.] How extremely kind of you, Lady Bracknell! I have\\nalso in my possession, you will be pleased to hear, certificates of\\nMiss Cardew’s birth, baptism, whooping cough, registration,\\nvaccination, confirmation, and the measles; both the German and the\\nEnglish variety.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nAh! A life crowded with incident, I see; though perhaps somewhat too\\nexciting for a young girl. I am not myself in favour of premature\\nexperiences. [Rises, looks at her watch.] Gwendolen! the time\\napproaches for our departure. We have not a moment to lose. As a matter\\nof form, Mr. Worthing, I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any\\nlittle fortune?\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh! about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the Funds. That is\\nall. Goodbye, Lady Bracknell. So pleased to have seen you.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Sitting down again.] A moment, Mr. Worthing. A hundred and thirty\\nthousand pounds! And in the Funds! Miss Cardew seems to me a most\\nattractive young lady, now that I look at her. Few girls of the present\\nday have any really solid qualities, any of the qualities that last,\\nand improve with time. We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces.\\n[To Cecily.] Come over here, dear. [Cecily goes across.] Pretty child!\\nyour dress is sadly simple, and your hair seems almost as Nature might\\nhave left it. But we can soon alter all that. A thoroughly experienced\\nFrench maid produces a really marvellous result in a very brief space\\nof time. I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing, and after\\nthree months her own husband did not know her.\\n\\nJACK.\\nAnd after six months nobody knew her.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Glares at Jack for a few moments. Then bends, with a practised smile,\\nto Cecily.] Kindly turn round, sweet child. [Cecily turns completely\\nround.] No, the side view is what I want. [Cecily presents her\\nprofile.] Yes, quite as I expected. There are distinct social\\npossibilities in your profile. The two weak points in our age are its\\nwant of principle and its want of profile. The chin a little higher,\\ndear. Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn. They are worn\\nvery high, just at present. Algernon!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, Aunt Augusta!\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThere are distinct social possibilities in Miss Cardew’s profile.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nCecily is the sweetest, dearest, prettiest girl in the whole world. And\\nI don’t care twopence about social possibilities.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nNever speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon. Only people who can’t\\nget into it do that. [To Cecily.] Dear child, of course you know that\\nAlgernon has nothing but his debts to depend upon. But I do not approve\\nof mercenary marriages. When I married Lord Bracknell I had no fortune\\nof any kind. But I never dreamed for a moment of allowing that to stand\\nin my way. Well, I suppose I must give my consent.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThank you, Aunt Augusta.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nCecily, you may kiss me!\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Kisses her.] Thank you, Lady Bracknell.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nYou may also address me as Aunt Augusta for the future.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nThank you, Aunt Augusta.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThe marriage, I think, had better take place quite soon.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThank you, Aunt Augusta.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nThank you, Aunt Augusta.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nTo speak frankly, I am not in favour of long engagements. They give\\npeople the opportunity of finding out each other’s character before\\nmarriage, which I think is never advisable.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI beg your pardon for interrupting you, Lady Bracknell, but this\\nengagement is quite out of the question. I am Miss Cardew’s guardian,\\nand she cannot marry without my consent until she comes of age. That\\nconsent I absolutely decline to give.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nUpon what grounds may I ask? Algernon is an extremely, I may almost say\\nan ostentatiously, eligible young man. He has nothing, but he looks\\neverything. What more can one desire?\\n\\nJACK.\\nIt pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you, Lady Bracknell,\\nabout your nephew, but the fact is that I do not approve at all of his\\nmoral character. I suspect him of being untruthful. [Algernon and\\nCecily look at him in indignant amazement.]\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nUntruthful! My nephew Algernon? Impossible! He is an Oxonian.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter. This afternoon\\nduring my temporary absence in London on an important question of\\nromance, he obtained admission to my house by means of the false\\npretence of being my brother. Under an assumed name he drank, I’ve just\\nbeen informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet,\\nBrut, ’89; wine I was specially reserving for myself. Continuing his\\ndisgraceful deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in\\nalienating the affections of my only ward. He subsequently stayed to\\ntea, and devoured every single muffin. And what makes his conduct all\\nthe more heartless is, that he was perfectly well aware from the first\\nthat I have no brother, that I never had a brother, and that I don’t\\nintend to have a brother, not even of any kind. I distinctly told him\\nso myself yesterday afternoon.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nAhem! Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration I have decided entirely\\nto overlook my nephew’s conduct to you.\\n\\nJACK.\\nThat is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell. My own decision, however,\\nis unalterable. I decline to give my consent.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[To Cecily.] Come here, sweet child. [Cecily goes over.] How old are\\nyou, dear?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nWell, I am really only eighteen, but I always admit to twenty when I go\\nto evening parties.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nYou are perfectly right in making some slight alteration. Indeed, no\\nwoman should ever be quite accurate about her age. It looks so\\ncalculating . . . [In a meditative manner.] Eighteen, but admitting to\\ntwenty at evening parties. Well, it will not be very long before you\\nare of age and free from the restraints of tutelage. So I don’t think\\nyour guardian’s consent is, after all, a matter of any importance.\\n\\nJACK.\\nPray excuse me, Lady Bracknell, for interrupting you again, but it is\\nonly fair to tell you that according to the terms of her grandfather’s\\nwill Miss Cardew does not come legally of age till she is thirty-five.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThat does not seem to me to be a grave objection. Thirty-five is a very\\nattractive age. London society is full of women of the very highest\\nbirth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty-five for\\nyears. Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point. To my own knowledge she\\nhas been thirty-five ever since she arrived at the age of forty, which\\nwas many years ago now. I see no reason why our dear Cecily should not\\nbe even still more attractive at the age you mention than she is at\\npresent. There will be a large accumulation of property.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nAlgy, could you wait for me till I was thirty-five?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOf course I could, Cecily. You know I could.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn’t wait all that time. I hate\\nwaiting even five minutes for anybody. It always makes me rather cross.\\nI am not punctual myself, I know, but I do like punctuality in others,\\nand waiting, even to be married, is quite out of the question.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThen what is to be done, Cecily?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI don’t know, Mr. Moncrieff.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nMy dear Mr. Worthing, as Miss Cardew states positively that she cannot\\nwait till she is thirty-five—a remark which I am bound to say seems to\\nme to show a somewhat impatient nature—I would beg of you to reconsider\\nyour decision.\\n\\nJACK.\\nBut my dear Lady Bracknell, the matter is entirely in your own hands.\\nThe moment you consent to my marriage with Gwendolen, I will most\\ngladly allow your nephew to form an alliance with my ward.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Rising and drawing herself up.] You must be quite aware that what you\\npropose is out of the question.\\n\\nJACK.\\nThen a passionate celibacy is all that any of us can look forward to.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThat is not the destiny I propose for Gwendolen. Algernon, of course,\\ncan choose for himself. [Pulls out her watch.] Come, dear, [Gwendolen\\nrises] we have already missed five, if not six, trains. To miss any\\nmore might expose us to comment on the platform.\\n\\n[Enter Dr. Chasuble.]\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nEverything is quite ready for the christenings.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThe christenings, sir! Is not that somewhat premature?\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\n[Looking rather puzzled, and pointing to Jack and Algernon.] Both these\\ngentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate baptism.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nAt their age? The idea is grotesque and irreligious! Algernon, I forbid\\nyou to be baptized. I will not hear of such excesses. Lord Bracknell\\nwould be highly displeased if he learned that that was the way in which\\nyou wasted your time and money.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nAm I to understand then that there are to be no christenings at all\\nthis afternoon?\\n\\nJACK.\\nI don’t think that, as things are now, it would be of much practical\\nvalue to either of us, Dr. Chasuble.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nI am grieved to hear such sentiments from you, Mr. Worthing. They\\nsavour of the heretical views of the Anabaptists, views that I have\\ncompletely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons. However, as your\\npresent mood seems to be one peculiarly secular, I will return to the\\nchurch at once. Indeed, I have just been informed by the pew-opener\\nthat for the last hour and a half Miss Prism has been waiting for me in\\nthe vestry.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Starting.] Miss Prism! Did I hear you mention a Miss Prism?\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nYes, Lady Bracknell. I am on my way to join her.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nPray allow me to detain you for a moment. This matter may prove to be\\none of vital importance to Lord Bracknell and myself. Is this Miss\\nPrism a female of repellent aspect, remotely connected with education?\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\n[Somewhat indignantly.] She is the most cultivated of ladies, and the\\nvery picture of respectability.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nIt is obviously the same person. May I ask what position she holds in\\nyour household?\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\n[Severely.] I am a celibate, madam.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Interposing.] Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, has been for the last three\\nyears Miss Cardew’s esteemed governess and valued companion.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nIn spite of what I hear of her, I must see her at once. Let her be sent\\nfor.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\n[Looking off.] She approaches; she is nigh.\\n\\n[Enter Miss Prism hurriedly.]\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nI was told you expected me in the vestry, dear Canon. I have been\\nwaiting for you there for an hour and three-quarters. [Catches sight of\\nLady Bracknell, who has fixed her with a stony glare. Miss Prism grows\\npale and quails. She looks anxiously round as if desirous to escape.]\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[In a severe, judicial voice.] Prism! [Miss Prism bows her head in\\nshame.] Come here, Prism! [Miss Prism approaches in a humble manner.]\\nPrism! Where is that baby? [General consternation. The Canon starts\\nback in horror. Algernon and Jack pretend to be anxious to shield\\nCecily and Gwendolen from hearing the details of a terrible public\\nscandal.] Twenty-eight years ago, Prism, you left Lord Bracknell’s\\nhouse, Number 104, Upper Grosvenor Street, in charge of a perambulator\\nthat contained a baby of the male sex. You never returned. A few weeks\\nlater, through the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan police,\\nthe perambulator was discovered at midnight, standing by itself in a\\nremote corner of Bayswater. It contained the manuscript of a\\nthree-volume novel of more than usually revolting sentimentality. [Miss\\nPrism starts in involuntary indignation.] But the baby was not there!\\n[Every one looks at Miss Prism.] Prism! Where is that baby? [A pause.]\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nLady Bracknell, I admit with shame that I do not know. I only wish I\\ndid. The plain facts of the case are these. On the morning of the day\\nyou mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory, I prepared as\\nusual to take the baby out in its perambulator. I had also with me a\\nsomewhat old, but capacious hand-bag in which I had intended to place\\nthe manuscript of a work of fiction that I had written during my few\\nunoccupied hours. In a moment of mental abstraction, for which I never\\ncan forgive myself, I deposited the manuscript in the basinette, and\\nplaced the baby in the hand-bag.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Who has been listening attentively.] But where did you deposit the\\nhand-bag?\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nDo not ask me, Mr. Worthing.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMiss Prism, this is a matter of no small importance to me. I insist on\\nknowing where you deposited the hand-bag that contained that infant.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nI left it in the cloak-room of one of the larger railway stations in\\nLondon.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWhat railway station?\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Quite crushed.] Victoria. The Brighton line. [Sinks into a chair.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nI must retire to my room for a moment. Gwendolen, wait here for me.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nIf you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life. [Exit\\nJack in great excitement.]\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nWhat do you think this means, Lady Bracknell?\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nI dare not even suspect, Dr. Chasuble. I need hardly tell you that in\\nfamilies of high position strange coincidences are not supposed to\\noccur. They are hardly considered the thing.\\n\\n[Noises heard overhead as if some one was throwing trunks about. Every\\none looks up.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nUncle Jack seems strangely agitated.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nYour guardian has a very emotional nature.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThis noise is extremely unpleasant. It sounds as if he was having an\\nargument. I dislike arguments of any kind. They are always vulgar, and\\noften convincing.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\n[Looking up.] It has stopped now. [The noise is redoubled.]\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nI wish he would arrive at some conclusion.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nThis suspense is terrible. I hope it will last. [Enter Jack with a\\nhand-bag of black leather in his hand.]\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Rushing over to Miss Prism.] Is this the hand-bag, Miss Prism? Examine\\nit carefully before you speak. The happiness of more than one life\\ndepends on your answer.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Calmly.] It seems to be mine. Yes, here is the injury it received\\nthrough the upsetting of a Gower Street omnibus in younger and happier\\ndays. Here is the stain on the lining caused by the explosion of a\\ntemperance beverage, an incident that occurred at Leamington. And here,\\non the lock, are my initials. I had forgotten that in an extravagant\\nmood I had had them placed there. The bag is undoubtedly mine. I am\\ndelighted to have it so unexpectedly restored to me. It has been a\\ngreat inconvenience being without it all these years.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[In a pathetic voice.] Miss Prism, more is restored to you than this\\nhand-bag. I was the baby you placed in it.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Amazed.] You?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Embracing her.] Yes . . . mother!\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Recoiling in indignant astonishment.] Mr. Worthing! I am unmarried!\\n\\nJACK.\\nUnmarried! I do not deny that is a serious blow. But after all, who has\\nthe right to cast a stone against one who has suffered? Cannot\\nrepentance wipe out an act of folly? Why should there be one law for\\nmen, and another for women? Mother, I forgive you. [Tries to embrace\\nher again.]\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Still more indignant.] Mr. Worthing, there is some error. [Pointing to\\nLady Bracknell.] There is the lady who can tell you who you really are.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[After a pause.] Lady Bracknell, I hate to seem inquisitive, but would\\nyou kindly inform me who I am?\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nI am afraid that the news I have to give you will not altogether please\\nyou. You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs. Moncrieff, and\\nconsequently Algernon’s elder brother.\\n\\nJACK.\\nAlgy’s elder brother! Then I have a brother after all. I knew I had a\\nbrother! I always said I had a brother! Cecily,—how could you have ever\\ndoubted that I had a brother? [Seizes hold of Algernon.] Dr. Chasuble,\\nmy unfortunate brother. Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother. Gwendolen,\\nmy unfortunate brother. Algy, you young scoundrel, you will have to\\ntreat me with more respect in the future. You have never behaved to me\\nlike a brother in all your life.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, not till to-day, old boy, I admit. I did my best, however, though\\nI was out of practice.\\n\\n[Shakes hands.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[To Jack.] My own! But what own are you? What is your Christian name,\\nnow that you have become some one else?\\n\\nJACK.\\nGood heavens! . . . I had quite forgotten that point. Your decision on\\nthe subject of my name is irrevocable, I suppose?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI never change, except in my affections.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nWhat a noble nature you have, Gwendolen!\\n\\nJACK.\\nThen the question had better be cleared up at once. Aunt Augusta, a\\nmoment. At the time when Miss Prism left me in the hand-bag, had I been\\nchristened already?\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nEvery luxury that money could buy, including christening, had been\\nlavished on you by your fond and doting parents.\\n\\nJACK.\\nThen I was christened! That is settled. Now, what name was I given? Let\\nme know the worst.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nBeing the eldest son you were naturally christened after your father.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Irritably.] Yes, but what was my father’s Christian name?\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Meditatively.] I cannot at the present moment recall what the\\nGeneral’s Christian name was. But I have no doubt he had one. He was\\neccentric, I admit. But only in later years. And that was the result of\\nthe Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion, and other things of\\nthat kind.\\n\\nJACK.\\nAlgy! Can’t you recollect what our father’s Christian name was?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nMy dear boy, we were never even on speaking terms. He died before I was\\na year old.\\n\\nJACK.\\nHis name would appear in the Army Lists of the period, I suppose, Aunt\\nAugusta?\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThe General was essentially a man of peace, except in his domestic\\nlife. But I have no doubt his name would appear in any military\\ndirectory.\\n\\nJACK.\\nThe Army Lists of the last forty years are here. These delightful\\nrecords should have been my constant study. [Rushes to bookcase and\\ntears the books out.] M. Generals . . . Mallam, Maxbohm, Magley, what\\nghastly names they have—Markby, Migsby, Mobbs, Moncrieff! Lieutenant\\n1840, Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel, Colonel, General 1869, Christian\\nnames, Ernest John. [Puts book very quietly down and speaks quite\\ncalmly.] I always told you, Gwendolen, my name was Ernest, didn’t I?\\nWell, it is Ernest after all. I mean it naturally is Ernest.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nYes, I remember now that the General was called Ernest, I knew I had\\nsome particular reason for disliking the name.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nErnest! My own Ernest! I felt from the first that you could have no\\nother name!\\n\\nJACK.\\nGwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that\\nall his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth. Can you\\nforgive me?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI can. For I feel that you are sure to change.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMy own one!\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\n[To Miss Prism.] Lætitia! [Embraces her]\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Enthusiastically.] Frederick! At last!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nCecily! [Embraces her.] At last!\\n\\nJACK.\\nGwendolen! [Embraces her.] At last!\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nMy nephew, you seem to be displaying signs of triviality.\\n\\nJACK.\\nOn the contrary, Aunt Augusta, I’ve now realised for the first time in\\nmy life the vital Importance of Being Earnest.\\n\\nTABLEAU\\n'"

       "'I\\n\\n\\nOne morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found\\nhimself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his\\narmour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his\\nbrown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.\\nThe bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off\\nany moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the\\nrest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.\\n\\n“What’s happened to me?” he thought. It wasn’t a dream. His room, a\\nproper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between\\nits four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out\\non the table—Samsa was a travelling salesman—and above it there hung a\\npicture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and\\nhoused in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur\\nhat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered\\nthe whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.\\n\\nGregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of\\nrain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.\\n“How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this\\nnonsense”, he thought, but that was something he was unable to do\\nbecause he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state\\ncouldn’t get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his\\nright, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a\\nhundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn’t have to look at the\\nfloundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull\\npain there that he had never felt before.\\n\\n“Oh, God”, he thought, “what a strenuous career it is that I’ve chosen!\\nTravelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more\\neffort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there’s\\nthe curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad\\nand irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that\\nyou can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can\\nall go to Hell!” He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself\\nslowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his\\nhead better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with\\nlots of little white spots which he didn’t know what to make of; and\\nwhen he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly\\nback because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold\\nshudder.\\n\\nHe slid back into his former position. “Getting up early all the time”,\\nhe thought, “it makes you stupid. You’ve got to get enough sleep. Other\\ntravelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go\\nback to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract,\\nthese gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts.\\nI ought to just try that with my boss; I’d get kicked out on the spot.\\nBut who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn’t\\nhave my parents to think about I’d have given in my notice a long time\\nago, I’d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell\\nhim everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He’d fall right\\noff his desk! And it’s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there\\nat your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,\\nespecially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard\\nof hearing. Well, there’s still some hope; once I’ve got the money\\ntogether to pay off my parents’ debt to him—another five or six years I\\nsuppose—that’s definitely what I’ll do. That’s when I’ll make the big\\nchange. First of all though, I’ve got to get up, my train leaves at\\nfive.”\\n\\nAnd he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.\\n“God in Heaven!” he thought. It was half past six and the hands were\\nquietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like\\nquarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the\\nbed that it had been set for four o’clock as it should have been; it\\ncertainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep\\nthrough that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept\\npeacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What\\nshould he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch\\nthat he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was\\nstill not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and\\nlively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his\\nboss’s anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the\\nfive o’clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor’s\\nnot being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss’s\\nman, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported\\nsick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in five\\nyears of service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would\\ncertainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance\\ncompany, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the\\ndoctor’s recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed\\nthat no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what’s more,\\nwould he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact,\\napart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel\\ncompletely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.\\n\\nHe was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to\\nget out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a\\ncautious knock at the door near his head. “Gregor”, somebody called—it\\nwas his mother—“it’s quarter to seven. Didn’t you want to go\\nsomewhere?” That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his own\\nvoice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had\\nbefore. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and\\nuncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out\\nat first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear,\\nleaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not. Gregor\\nhad wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the\\ncircumstances contented himself with saying: “Yes, mother, yes,\\nthank-you, I’m getting up now.” The change in Gregor’s voice probably\\ncould not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother was\\nsatisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. But this short\\nconversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor,\\nagainst their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came\\nknocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. “Gregor,\\nGregor”, he called, “what’s wrong?” And after a short while he called\\nagain with a warning deepness in his voice: “Gregor! Gregor!” At the\\nother side door his sister came plaintively: “Gregor? Aren’t you well?\\nDo you need anything?” Gregor answered to both sides: “I’m ready, now”,\\nmaking an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by\\nenunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each,\\nindividual word. His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister\\nwhispered: “Gregor, open the door, I beg of you.” Gregor, however, had\\nno thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for\\nhis cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors\\nat night even when he was at home.\\n\\nThe first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being\\ndisturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only\\nthen would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he\\nwould not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in\\nbed. He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps\\ncaused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure\\nimagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve\\nthemselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt that the change\\nin his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold,\\nwhich was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.\\n\\nIt was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow\\nhimself up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became\\ndifficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He\\nwould have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead\\nof them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in\\ndifferent directions, and which he was moreover unable to control. If\\nhe wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would\\nstretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with\\nthat leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about\\npainfully. “This is something that can’t be done in bed”, Gregor said\\nto himself, “so don’t keep trying to do it”.\\n\\nThe first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out\\nof the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not\\nimagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it\\nwent so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly\\nshoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose\\nthe wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned\\nfrom the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might\\nwell, at present, be the most sensitive.\\n\\nSo then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first,\\ncarefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily,\\nand despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually\\nfollowed slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last\\ngot his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him\\nthat if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not\\ninjured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the\\nsame way. And he could not knock himself out now at any price; better\\nto stay in bed than lose consciousness.\\n\\nIt took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier,\\nbut when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as\\nthey struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was\\npossible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this\\nchaos. He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to\\nstay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free\\nof it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice. At the same time,\\nthough, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was\\nmuch better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At times like this\\nhe would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he\\ncould, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was\\nenveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to\\noffer him. “Seven o’clock, already”, he said to himself when the clock\\nstruck again, “seven o’clock, and there’s still a fog like this.” And\\nhe lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps\\nexpected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and\\nnatural state.\\n\\nBut then he said to himself: “Before it strikes quarter past seven I’ll\\ndefinitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody\\nwill have come round from work to ask what’s happened to me as well, as\\nthey open up at work before seven o’clock.” And so he set himself to\\nthe task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all\\nat the same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and\\nkept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it.\\nHis back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to\\nit falling onto the carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise he\\nwas bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably\\nraise concern if not alarm. But it was something that had to be risked.\\n\\nWhen Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed—the new method\\nwas more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and\\nforth—it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody\\ncame to help him. Two strong people—he had his father and the maid in\\nmind—would have been more than enough; they would only have to push\\ntheir arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend\\ndown with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over\\nonto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use.\\nShould he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that\\nall the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he\\ncould not suppress a smile at this thought.\\n\\nAfter a while he had already moved so far across that it would have\\nbeen hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time\\nwas now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very\\nsoon. Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. “That’ll be\\nsomeone from work”, he said to himself, and froze very still, although\\nhis little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around.\\nFor a moment everything remained quiet. “They’re not opening the door”,\\nGregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of\\ncourse, the maid’s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it.\\nGregor only needed to hear the visitor’s first words of greeting and he\\nknew who it was—the chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the\\nonly one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became\\nhighly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees,\\nevery one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful\\nand devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he\\ncouldn’t get out of bed if he didn’t spend at least a couple of hours\\nin the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let one\\nof the trainees make enquiries—assuming enquiries were even\\nnecessary—did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have\\nto show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that\\nonly the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate\\nit? And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any\\nproper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed.\\nThere was a loud thump, but it wasn’t really a loud noise. His fall was\\nsoftened a little by the carpet, and Gregor’s back was also more\\nelastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too\\nnoticeable. He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit\\nit as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against\\nthe carpet.\\n\\n“Something’s fallen down in there”, said the chief clerk in the room on\\nthe left. Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that\\nhad happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you\\nhad to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this\\nquestion, the chief clerk’s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots\\ncould now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right,\\nGregor’s sister whispered to him to let him know: “Gregor, the chief\\nclerk is here.” “Yes, I know”, said Gregor to himself; but without\\ndaring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.\\n\\n“Gregor”, said his father now from the room to his left, “the chief\\nclerk has come round and wants to know why you didn’t leave on the\\nearly train. We don’t know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants to\\nspeak to you personally. So please open up this door. I’m sure he’ll be\\ngood enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.” Then the chief\\nclerk called “Good morning, Mr. Samsa”. “He isn’t well”, said his\\nmother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through\\nthe door. “He isn’t well, please believe me. Why else would Gregor have\\nmissed a train! The lad only ever thinks about the business. It nearly\\nmakes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings; he’s been in\\ntown for a week now but stayed home every evening. He sits with us in\\nthe kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables. His\\nidea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw. He’s made a little\\nframe, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you’ll be\\namazed how nice it is; it’s hanging up in his room; you’ll see it as\\nsoon as Gregor opens the door. Anyway, I’m glad you’re here; we\\nwouldn’t have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves;\\nhe’s so stubborn; and I’m sure he isn’t well, he said this morning that\\nhe is, but he isn’t.” “I’ll be there in a moment”, said Gregor slowly\\nand thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word\\nof the conversation. “Well I can’t think of any other way of explaining\\nit, Mrs. Samsa”, said the chief clerk, “I hope it’s nothing serious.\\nBut on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever\\nbecome slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like,\\nwe simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.” “Can\\nthe chief clerk come in to see you now then?”, asked his father\\nimpatiently, knocking at the door again. “No”, said Gregor. In the room\\non his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left\\nhis sister began to cry.\\n\\nSo why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only\\njust got up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was she\\ncrying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief\\nclerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that\\nhappened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same\\ndemands as before? There was no need to worry about things like that\\nyet. Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of\\nabandoning his family. For the time being he just lay there on the\\ncarpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would seriously\\nhave expected him to let the chief clerk in. It was only a minor\\ndiscourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later\\non, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot.\\nAnd it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace\\ninstead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying. But the\\nothers didn’t know what was happening, they were worried, that would\\nexcuse their behaviour.\\n\\nThe chief clerk now raised his voice, “Mr. Samsa”, he called to him,\\n“what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more\\nthan yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary\\nconcern to your parents and you fail—and I mention this just by the\\nway—you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite\\nunheard of. I’m speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your\\nemployer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation. I\\nam astonished, quite astonished. I thought I knew you as a calm and\\nsensible person, and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with\\npeculiar whims. This morning, your employer did suggest a possible\\nreason for your failure to appear, it’s true—it had to do with the\\nmoney that was recently entrusted to you—but I came near to giving him\\nmy word of honour that that could not be the right explanation. But now\\nthat I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish\\nwhatsoever to intercede on your behalf. And nor is your position all\\nthat secure. I had originally intended to say all this to you in\\nprivate, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good\\nreason I don’t see why your parents should not also learn of it. Your\\nturnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it’s\\nnot the time of year to do especially good business, we recognise that;\\nbut there simply is no time of year to do no business at all, Mr.\\nSamsa, we cannot allow there to be.”\\n\\n“But Sir”, called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the\\nexcitement, “I’ll open up immediately, just a moment. I’m slightly\\nunwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven’t been able to get up. I’m\\nstill in bed now. I’m quite fresh again now, though. I’m just getting\\nout of bed. Just a moment. Be patient! It’s not quite as easy as I’d\\nthought. I’m quite alright now, though. It’s shocking, what can\\nsuddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright last night, my parents\\nknow about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it last\\nnight already. They must have noticed it. I don’t know why I didn’t let\\nyou know at work! But you always think you can get over an illness\\nwithout staying at home. Please, don’t make my parents suffer! There’s\\nno basis for any of the accusations you’re making; nobody’s ever said a\\nword to me about any of these things. Maybe you haven’t read the latest\\ncontracts I sent in. I’ll set off with the eight o’clock train, as\\nwell, these few hours of rest have given me strength. You don’t need to\\nwait, sir; I’ll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good\\nas to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him!”\\n\\nAnd while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was\\nsaying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers—this was easily\\ndone, probably because of the practise he had already had in bed—where\\nhe now tried to get himself upright. He really did want to open the\\ndoor, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief\\nclerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn\\nwhat they would say when they caught sight of him. If they were shocked\\nthen it would no longer be Gregor’s responsibility and he could rest.\\nIf, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no reason\\nto be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at the station for\\neight o’clock. The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth\\nchest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself\\none last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was\\nin serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let\\nhimself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the\\nedges of it with his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and\\nkept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.\\n\\n“Did you understand a word of all that?” the chief clerk asked his\\nparents, “surely he’s not trying to make fools of us”. “Oh, God!”\\ncalled his mother, who was already in tears, “he could be seriously ill\\nand we’re making him suffer. Grete! Grete!” she then cried. “Mother?”\\nhis sister called from the other side. They communicated across\\nGregor’s room. “You’ll have to go for the doctor straight away. Gregor\\nis ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just\\nnow?” “That was the voice of an animal”, said the chief clerk, with a\\ncalmness that was in contrast with his mother’s screams. “Anna! Anna!”\\nhis father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping\\nhis hands, “get a locksmith here, now!” And the two girls, their skirts\\nswishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the\\nfront door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get\\ndressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again;\\nthey must have left it open; people often do in homes where something\\nawful has happened.\\n\\nGregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn’t\\nunderstand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to\\nhim, clearer than before—perhaps his ears had become used to the sound.\\nThey had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and\\nwere ready to help. The first response to his situation had been\\nconfident and wise, and that made him feel better. He felt that he had\\nbeen drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith\\nhe expected great and surprising achievements—although he did not\\nreally distinguish one from the other. Whatever was said next would be\\ncrucial, so, in order to make his voice as clear as possible, he\\ncoughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even\\nthis might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he\\nwas no longer sure he could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, it had\\nbecome very quiet in the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the\\ntable whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed\\nagainst the door and listening.\\n\\nGregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once\\nthere he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself\\nupright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. He\\nrested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and\\nthen set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his\\nmouth. He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth—how was he,\\nthen, to grasp the key?—but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up\\nfor with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really was able to start\\nthe key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some\\nkind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the\\nkey and dripped onto the floor. “Listen”, said the chief clerk in the\\nnext room, “he’s turning the key.” Gregor was greatly encouraged by\\nthis; but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his\\nmother too: “Well done, Gregor”, they should have cried, “keep at it,\\nkeep hold of the lock!” And with the idea that they were all excitedly\\nfollowing his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying\\nno attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key turned\\nround he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright\\nwith his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the\\nwhole weight of his body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as it\\nsnapped back was Gregor’s sign that he could break his concentration,\\nand as he regained his breath he said to himself: “So, I didn’t need\\nthe locksmith after all”. Then he lay his head on the handle of the\\ndoor to open it completely.\\n\\nBecause he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open\\nbefore he could be seen. He had first to slowly turn himself around one\\nof the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not\\nwant to fall flat on his back before entering the room. He was still\\noccupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to\\nanything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud “Oh!”,\\nwhich sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now he also saw him—he was\\nthe nearest to the door—his hand pressed against his open mouth and\\nslowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force.\\nGregor’s mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief\\nclerk’s being there, looked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms,\\ntook two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into\\nher skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head\\ndisappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and\\nclenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room.\\nThen he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with\\nhis hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.\\n\\nSo Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the\\nother door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half\\nof his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant\\nover to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had\\nbecome much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the\\nother side of the street—which was a hospital—could be seen quite\\nclearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its\\nfaçade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual\\ndroplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from\\nbreakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for\\nGregor’s father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and\\nhe would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of\\ndifferent newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph\\nof Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand\\nand a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his\\nuniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the\\nfront door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and\\nthe stairs where they began their way down below.\\n\\n“Now, then”, said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to have\\nkept calm, “I’ll get dressed straight away now, pack up my samples and\\nset off. Will you please just let me leave? You can see”, he said to\\nthe chief clerk, “that I’m not stubborn and I like to do my job; being\\na commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn’t\\nearn my living. So where are you going, in to the office? Yes? Will you\\nreport everything accurately, then? It’s quite possible for someone to\\nbe temporarily unable to work, but that’s just the right time to\\nremember what’s been achieved in the past and consider that later on,\\nonce the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all\\nthe more diligence and concentration. You’re well aware that I’m\\nseriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my\\nparents and my sister, so that I’m trapped in a difficult situation,\\nbut I will work my way out of it again. Please don’t make things any\\nharder for me than they are already, and don’t take sides against me at\\nthe office. I know that nobody likes the travellers. They think we earn\\nan enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it. That’s just\\nprejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it. But\\nyou, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in\\nfact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss\\nhimself—it’s very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes\\nabout his employees and judge them more harshly than he should. And\\nyou’re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year\\naway from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip\\nand chance and groundless complaints, and it’s almost impossible to\\ndefend yourself from that sort of thing, we don’t usually even hear\\nabout them, or if at all it’s when we arrive back home exhausted from a\\ntrip, and that’s when we feel the harmful effects of what’s been going\\non without even knowing what caused them. Please, don’t go away, at\\nleast first say something to show that you grant that I’m at least\\npartly right!”\\n\\nBut the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to\\nspeak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his\\ntrembling shoulders as he left. He did not keep still for a moment\\nwhile Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without\\ntaking his eyes off him. He moved very gradually, as if there had been\\nsome secret prohibition on leaving the room. It was only when he had\\nreached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement, drew his foot\\nfrom the living room, and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall, he\\nstretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there,\\nthere were some supernatural force waiting to save him.\\n\\nGregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk\\ngo away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into\\nextreme danger. That was something his parents did not understand very\\nwell; over the years, they had become convinced that this job would\\nprovide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much\\nto worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for\\nthe future. Gregor, though, did think about the future. The chief clerk\\nhad to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the\\nfuture of Gregor and his family depended on it! If only his sister were\\nhere! She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still\\nlying peacefully on his back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women,\\nsurely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the\\nentrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state. But his sister was\\nnot there, Gregor would have to do the job himself. And without\\nconsidering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move\\nabout in his present state, or that his speech still might not—or\\nprobably would not—be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself\\nthrough the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who,\\nridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but\\nGregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought\\nsomething to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs. Hardly had\\nthat happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feel\\nalright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under them;\\nto his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were even\\nmaking the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and he was soon\\nbelieving that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end. He held\\nback the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there\\non the floor. His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed,\\nat first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up\\nwith her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: “Help, for\\npity’s sake, Help!” The way she held her head suggested she wanted to\\nsee Gregor better, but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards\\nshowed that she did not; she had forgotten that the table was behind\\nher with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the table she\\nsat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even\\nseeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush\\nof coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.\\n\\n“Mother, mother”, said Gregor gently, looking up at her. He had\\ncompletely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help\\nhimself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of\\ncoffee. That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from the table and\\ninto the arms of his father as he rushed towards her. Gregor, though,\\nhad no time to spare for his parents now; the chief clerk had already\\nreached the stairs; with his chin on the banister, he looked back for\\nthe last time. Gregor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of\\nreaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt\\ndown several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all\\naround the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed,\\nunfortunately, to put Gregor’s father into a panic as well. Until then\\nhe had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running\\nafter the chief clerk himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he\\nran after him, Gregor’s father seized the chief clerk’s stick in his\\nright hand (the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with\\nhis hat and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with\\nhis left, and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping\\nhis foot at him as he went. Gregor’s appeals to his father were of no\\nhelp, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly\\nturned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.\\nAcross the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor’s mother had pulled\\nopen a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face. A\\nstrong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the\\ncurtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of\\nthem were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop Gregor’s father as\\nhe drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man. Gregor\\nhad never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go\\nvery slowly. If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would\\nhave been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he\\ntook the time to do that his father would become impatient, and there\\nwas the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in\\nhis father’s hand any moment. Eventually, though, Gregor realised that\\nhe had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable\\nof going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as\\npossible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn\\nhimself round. It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able to\\nsee his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact now\\nand then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a\\ndistance as to which way to turn. If only his father would stop that\\nunbearable hissing! It was making Gregor quite confused. When he had\\nnearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, he made\\na mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come. He\\nwas pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway, but\\nthen saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get\\nthrough it without further difficulty. In his present mood, it\\nobviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double\\ndoors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through. He was\\nmerely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room\\nas quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time\\nto get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway.\\nWhat he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards\\nall the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to\\nGregor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not\\na pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway\\nwithout regard for what might happen. One side of his body lifted\\nitself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the\\nwhite door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it,\\nsoon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by\\nhimself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while\\nthose on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground. Then\\nhis father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from\\nwhere he was held and sent him flying, and heavily bleeding, deep into\\nhis room. The door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all\\nwas quiet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\n\\nIt was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke\\nfrom his deep and coma-like sleep. He would have woken soon afterwards\\nanyway even if he hadn’t been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep and\\nfelt fully rested. But he had the impression that some hurried steps\\nand the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully\\nshut had woken him. The light from the electric street lamps shone\\npalely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but\\ndown below, where Gregor was, it was dark. He pushed himself over to\\nthe door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae—of which he was\\nnow beginning to learn the value—in order to see what had been\\nhappening there. The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully\\nstretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs. One of the\\nlegs had been badly injured in the events of that morning—it was nearly\\na miracle that only one of them had been—and dragged along lifelessly.\\n\\nIt was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it\\nactually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of\\nsomething to eat. By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened\\nmilk with little pieces of white bread floating in it. He was so\\npleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he had been\\nthat morning, and immediately dipped his head into the milk, nearly\\ncovering his eyes with it. But he soon drew his head back again in\\ndisappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left side make it\\ndifficult to eat the food—he was only able to eat if his whole body\\nworked together as a snuffling whole—but the milk did not taste at all\\nnice. Milk like this was normally his favourite drink, and his sister\\nhad certainly left it there for him because of that, but he turned,\\nalmost against his own will, away from the dish and crawled back into\\nthe centre of the room.\\n\\nThrough the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been\\nlit in the living room. His father at this time would normally be sat\\nwith his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor’s\\nmother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not a sound to\\nbe heard. Gregor’s sister would often write and tell him about this\\nreading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times. It\\nwas so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody\\nin the flat. “What a quiet life it is the family lead”, said Gregor to\\nhimself, and, gazing into the darkness, felt a great pride that he was\\nable to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and\\nparents. But what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should\\ncome to a horrible and frightening end? That was something that Gregor\\ndid not want to think about too much, so he started to move about,\\ncrawling up and down the room.\\n\\nOnce during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was\\nopened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on\\nthe other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the\\nroom but thought better of it. Gregor went and waited immediately by\\nthe door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room\\nin some way or at least to find out who it was; but the door was opened\\nno more that night and Gregor waited in vain. The previous morning\\nwhile the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him,\\nbut now, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had\\nclearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the\\nkeys were in the other sides.\\n\\nIt was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was\\nput out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had\\nstayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as\\nthey went away together on tip-toe. It was clear that no-one would come\\ninto Gregor’s room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time\\nto think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life.\\nFor some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain\\nmade him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor, even though he\\nhad been living in it for five years. Hardly aware of what he was doing\\nother than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch. It\\npressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able to lift\\nhis head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only\\nregret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath.\\n\\nHe spent the whole night there. Some of the time he passed in a light\\nsleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his\\nhunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes\\nwhich, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being\\nhe must remain calm, he must show patience and the greatest\\nconsideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he,\\nin his present condition, was forced to impose on them.\\n\\nGregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions,\\nas early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his\\nsister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and\\nlooked anxiously in. She did not see him straight away, but when she\\ndid notice him under the couch—he had to be somewhere, for God’s sake,\\nhe couldn’t have flown away—she was so shocked that she lost control of\\nherself and slammed the door shut again from outside. But she seemed to\\nregret her behaviour, as she opened the door again straight away and\\ncame in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or\\neven of a stranger. Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the\\nedge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that he had left\\nthe milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and\\nbring him in some other food that was more suitable? If she didn’t do\\nit herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it,\\nalthough he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the\\ncouch, throw himself at his sister’s feet and beg her for something\\ngood to eat. However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and\\nlooked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some\\nsurprise. She immediately picked it up—using a rag, not her bare\\nhands—and carried it out. Gregor was extremely curious as to what she\\nwould bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he\\nnever could have guessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did\\nbring. In order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of\\nthings, all spread out on an old newspaper. There were old, half-rotten\\nvegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that\\nhad gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had\\ndeclared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread\\nwith butter and salt. As well as all that she had poured some water\\ninto the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for\\nGregor’s use, and placed it beside them. Then, out of consideration for\\nGregor’s feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her,\\nshe hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that\\nGregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he\\nliked. Gregor’s little legs whirred, at last he could eat. What’s more,\\nhis injuries must already have completely healed as he found no\\ndifficulty in moving. This amazed him, as more than a month earlier he\\nhad cut his finger slightly with a knife, he thought of how his finger\\nhad still hurt the day before yesterday. “Am I less sensitive than I\\nused to be, then?”, he thought, and was already sucking greedily at the\\ncheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much\\nmore than the other foods on the newspaper. Quickly one after another,\\nhis eyes watering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables\\nand the sauce; the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn’t like at\\nall, and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away\\nfrom them because he couldn’t stand the smell. Long after he had\\nfinished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly\\nturned the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw. He\\nwas immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he\\nhurried back under the couch. But he needed great self-control to stay\\nthere even for the short time that his sister was in the room, as\\neating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could\\nhardly breathe in that narrow space. Half suffocating, he watched with\\nbulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up\\nthe left-overs, mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at\\nall as if it could not be used any more. She quickly dropped it all\\ninto a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out.\\nShe had hardly turned her back before Gregor came out again from under\\nthe couch and stretched himself.\\n\\nThis was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the morning\\nwhile his parents and the maid were still asleep, and the second time\\nafter everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would\\nsleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor’s sister would send\\nthe maid away on some errand. Gregor’s father and mother certainly did\\nnot want him to starve either, but perhaps it would have been more than\\nthey could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being\\ntold about it, and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what\\ndistress she could as they were indeed suffering enough.\\n\\nIt was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor\\nand the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat. As\\nnobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister, thought that\\nhe could understand them, so he had to be content to hear his sister’s\\nsighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room. It was\\nonly later, when she had become a little more used to everything—there\\nwas, of course, no question of her ever becoming fully used to the\\nsituation—that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at\\nleast a comment that could be construed as friendly. “He’s enjoyed his\\ndinner today”, she might say when he had diligently cleared away all\\nthe food left for him, or if he left most of it, which slowly became\\nmore and more frequent, she would often say, sadly, “now everything’s\\njust been left there again”.\\n\\nAlthough Gregor wasn’t able to hear any news directly he did listen to\\nmuch of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heard anyone\\nspeaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his\\nwhole body against it. There was seldom any conversation, especially at\\nfirst, that was not about him in some way, even if only in secret. For\\ntwo whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what they\\nshould do now; but even between meals they spoke about the same subject\\nas there were always at least two members of the family at home—nobody\\nwanted to be at home by themselves and it was out of the question to\\nleave the flat entirely empty. And on the very first day the maid had\\nfallen to her knees and begged Gregor’s mother to let her go without\\ndelay. It was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but\\nshe left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor’s\\nmother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service.\\nShe even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what\\nhad happened, even though no-one had asked that of her.\\n\\nNow Gregor’s sister also had to help his mother with the cooking;\\nalthough that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much. Gregor\\noften heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat,\\nand receive no more answer than “no thanks, I’ve had enough” or\\nsomething similar. No-one drank very much either. His sister would\\nsometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping for the\\nchance to go and fetch it herself. When his father then said nothing\\nshe would add, so that he would not feel selfish, that she could send\\nthe housekeeper for it, but then his father would close the matter with\\na big, loud “No”, and no more would be said.\\n\\nEven before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained\\nto Gregor’s mother and sister what their finances and prospects were.\\nNow and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or\\ndocument from the little cash box he had saved from his business when\\nit had collapsed five years earlier. Gregor heard how he opened the\\ncomplicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item\\nhe wanted. What he heard his father say was some of the first good news\\nthat Gregor heard since he had first been incarcerated in his room. He\\nhad thought that nothing at all remained from his father’s business, at\\nleast he had never told him anything different, and Gregor had never\\nasked him about it anyway. Their business misfortune had reduced the\\nfamily to a state of total despair, and Gregor’s only concern at that\\ntime had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it\\nas quickly as possible. So then he started working especially hard,\\nwith a fiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a\\ntravelling representative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance\\nto earn money in quite different ways. Gregor converted his success at\\nwork straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the\\nbenefit of his astonished and delighted family. They had been good\\ntimes and they had never come again, at least not with the same\\nsplendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a\\nposition to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them. They\\nhad even got used to it, both Gregor and the family, they took the\\nmoney with gratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was\\nno longer much warm affection given in return. Gregor only remained\\nclose to his sister now. Unlike him, she was very fond of music and a\\ngifted and expressive violinist, it was his secret plan to send her to\\nthe conservatory next year even though it would cause great expense\\nthat would have to be made up for in some other way. During Gregor’s\\nshort periods in town, conversation with his sister would often turn to\\nthe conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that\\ncould never be realised. Their parents did not like to hear this\\ninnocent talk, but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he\\nwould let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it on\\nChristmas day.\\n\\nThat was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind\\nin his present state, pressed upright against the door and listening.\\nThere were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening,\\nwhen his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it\\nup again with a start, as even the slightest noise he caused would be\\nheard next door and they would all go silent. “What’s that he’s doing\\nnow”, his father would say after a while, clearly having gone over to\\nthe door, and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be\\ntaken up again.\\n\\nWhen explaining things, his father repeated himself several times,\\npartly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these\\nmatters himself and partly because Gregor’s mother did not understand\\neverything the first time. From these repeated explanations Gregor\\nlearned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was\\nstill some money available from the old days. It was not a lot, but it\\nhad not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated.\\nBesides that, they had not been using up all the money that Gregor had\\nbeen bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so\\nthat that, too, had been accumulating. Behind the door, Gregor nodded\\nwith enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution.\\nHe could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father’s\\ndebt to his boss, and the day when he could have freed himself from\\nthat job would have come much closer, but now it was certainly better\\nthe way his father had done things.\\n\\nThis money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to\\nlive off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one\\nor two years, no more. That’s to say, it was money that should not\\nreally be touched but set aside for emergencies; money to live on had\\nto be earned. His father was healthy but old, and lacking in self\\nconfidence. During the five years that he had not been working—the\\nfirst holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success—he\\nhad put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy. Would\\nGregor’s elderly mother now have to go and earn money? She suffered\\nfrom asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home,\\nevery other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the\\nopen window. Would his sister have to go and earn money? She was still\\na child of seventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable,\\nconsisting of wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the\\nbusiness, joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all\\nplaying the violin. Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn\\nmoney, Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw\\nhimself onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot\\nwith shame and regret.\\n\\nHe would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink\\nbut scratching at the leather for hours on end. Or he might go to all\\nthe effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill\\nand, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to stare out of it.\\nHe had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing\\nit now was obviously something more remembered than experienced, as\\nwhat he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day,\\neven things that were quite near; he had used to curse the ever-present\\nview of the hospital across the street, but now he could not see it at\\nall, and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which\\nwas a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could\\nhave thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where\\nthe grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably. His observant\\nsister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always\\npush it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied\\nup the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then\\non.\\n\\nIf Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for\\nall that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to\\nbear it; but as it was it caused him pain. His sister, naturally, tried\\nas far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it,\\nand the longer it went on, of course, the better she was able to do so,\\nbut as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much\\nbetter. It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she\\nentered the room. No sooner had she come in than she would quickly\\nclose the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the\\nview into Gregor’s room, then she would go straight to the window and\\npull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if it\\nwas cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little\\nwhile. She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and\\nnoise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while,\\nknowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this\\nordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him\\nwith the windows closed.\\n\\nOne day, about a month after Gregor’s transformation when his sister no\\nlonger had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance, she\\ncame into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still\\nstaring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be most\\nhorrible. In itself, his sister’s not coming into the room would have\\nbeen no surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult for her to\\nimmediately open the window while he was still there, but not only did\\nshe not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her,\\na stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite\\nher. Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch, of course,\\nbut he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she\\nseemed much more uneasy than usual. It made him realise that she still\\nfound his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, she\\nprobably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little\\nbit of him that protruded from under the couch. One day, in order to\\nspare her even this sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet\\nover to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely\\ncovered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent\\ndown. If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to\\ndo was take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no\\npleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely. She left the\\nsheet where it was. Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude\\none time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how\\nhis sister liked the new arrangement.\\n\\nFor the first fourteen days, Gregor’s parents could not bring\\nthemselves to come into the room to see him. He would often hear them\\nsay how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even\\nthough, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless\\nand frequently been annoyed with her. But now the two of them, father\\nand mother, would often both wait outside the door of Gregor’s room\\nwhile his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she went out again\\nshe would have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Gregor\\nhad eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any\\nslight improvement could be seen. His mother also wanted to go in and\\nvisit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first\\npersuaded her against it. Gregor listened very closely to all this, and\\napproved fully. Later, though, she had to be held back by force, which\\nmade her call out: “Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son!\\nCan’t you understand I have to see him?”, and Gregor would think to\\nhimself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every\\nday of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand\\neverything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was\\nstill just a child after all, and really might not have had an adult’s\\nappreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.\\n\\nGregor’s wish to see his mother was soon realised. Out of consideration\\nfor his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during\\nthe day, the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room\\nto crawl about, it was hard to just lie quietly through the night, his\\nfood soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain\\nhimself, he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and\\nceiling. He was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling; it was\\nquite different from lying on the floor; he could breathe more freely;\\nhis body had a light swing to it; and up there, relaxed and almost\\nhappy, it might happen that he would surprise even himself by letting\\ngo of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash. But now, of\\ncourse, he had far better control of his body than before and, even\\nwith a fall as great as that, caused himself no damage. Very soon his\\nsister noticed Gregor’s new way of entertaining himself—he had, after\\nall, left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about—and\\ngot it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing\\nthe furniture that got in his way, especially the chest of drawers and\\nthe desk. Now, this was not something that she would be able to do by\\nherself; she did not dare to ask for help from her father; the sixteen\\nyear old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she\\ncertainly would not have helped in this, she had even asked to be\\nallowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to\\nopen the door unless it was especially important; so his sister had no\\nchoice but to choose some time when Gregor’s father was not there and\\nfetch his mother to help her. As she approached the room, Gregor could\\nhear his mother express her joy, but once at the door she went silent.\\nFirst, of course, his sister came in and looked round to see that\\neverything in the room was alright; and only then did she let her\\nmother enter. Gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the\\ncouch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if\\nit had just been thrown down by chance. Gregor also refrained, this\\ntime, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to\\nsee his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come. “You\\ncan come in, he can’t be seen”, said his sister, obviously leading her\\nin by the hand. The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of\\nfeeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they pushed it\\nfrom its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the\\nwork for herself and ignoring her mother’s warnings that she would\\nstrain herself. This lasted a very long time. After labouring at it for\\nfifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the\\nchest where it was, for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the\\njob finished before Gregor’s father got home and leaving it in the\\nmiddle of the room it would be in his way even more, and for another\\nthing it wasn’t even sure that taking the furniture away would really\\nbe any help to him. She thought just the opposite; the sight of the\\nbare walls saddened her right to her heart; and why wouldn’t Gregor\\nfeel the same way about it, he’d been used to this furniture in his\\nroom for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an\\nempty room like that. Then, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting\\nGregor (whose whereabouts she did not know) to hear not even the tone\\nof her voice, as she was convinced that he did not understand her\\nwords, she added “and by taking the furniture away, won’t it seem like\\nwe’re showing that we’ve given up all hope of improvement and we’re\\nabandoning him to cope for himself? I think it’d be best to leave the\\nroom exactly the way it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us\\nagain he’ll find everything unchanged and he’ll be able to forget the\\ntime in between all the easier”.\\n\\nHearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the lack\\nof any direct human communication, along with the monotonous life led\\nby the family during these two months, must have made him confused—he\\ncould think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had\\nseriously wanted his room emptied out. Had he really wanted to\\ntransform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice\\nfurniture he had inherited? That would have let him crawl around\\nunimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let him quickly\\nforget his past when he had still been human. He had come very close to\\nforgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for\\nso long, that had shaken him out of it. Nothing should be removed;\\neverything had to stay; he could not do without the good influence the\\nfurniture had on his condition; and if the furniture made it difficult\\nfor him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great\\nadvantage.\\n\\nHis sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the\\nidea, not without reason, that she was Gregor’s spokesman to his\\nparents about the things that concerned him. This meant that his\\nmother’s advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing\\nnot only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she had thought at\\nfirst, but all the furniture apart from the all-important couch. It was\\nmore than childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected confidence\\nshe had recently acquired, that made her insist; she had indeed noticed\\nthat Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the\\nfurniture, as far as anyone could see, was of no use to him at all.\\nGirls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel\\nthey must get their way whenever they can. Perhaps this was what\\ntempted Grete to make Gregor’s situation seem even more shocking than\\nit was so that she could do even more for him. Grete would probably be\\nthe only one who would dare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling\\nabout the bare walls by himself.\\n\\nSo she refused to let her mother dissuade her. Gregor’s mother already\\nlooked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and helped\\nGregor’s sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she\\nhad. The chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without if\\nhe had to, but the writing desk had to stay. Hardly had the two women\\npushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out of the room than Gregor\\npoked his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about\\nit. He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could, but,\\nunfortunately, it was his mother who came back first while Grete in the\\nnext room had her arms round the chest, pushing and pulling at it from\\nside to side by herself without, of course, moving it an inch. His\\nmother was not used to the sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill,\\nso Gregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch. In his\\nstartlement, though, he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front\\nfrom moving a little. It was enough to attract his mother’s attention.\\nShe stood very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out\\nto Grete.\\n\\nGregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was\\nhappening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all,\\nbut he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their little\\ncalls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor, all\\nthese things made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides.\\nWith his head and legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to\\nthe floor, he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand\\nall of this much longer. They were emptying his room out; taking away\\neverything that was dear to him; they had already taken out the chest\\ncontaining his fretsaw and other tools; now they threatened to remove\\nthe writing desk with its place clearly worn into the floor, the desk\\nwhere he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school,\\neven while he had been at infant school—he really could not wait any\\nlonger to see whether the two women’s intentions were good. He had\\nnearly forgotten they were there anyway, as they were now too tired to\\nsay anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as\\nthey stepped heavily on the floor.\\n\\nSo, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room\\ncatching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times not\\nknowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly\\ncaught by the picture on the wall—which was already denuded of\\neverything else that had been on it—of the lady dressed in copious fur.\\nHe hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass,\\nit held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly. This picture at\\nleast, now totally covered by Gregor, would certainly be taken away by\\nno-one. He turned his head to face the door into the living room so\\nthat he could watch the women when they came back.\\n\\nThey had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon;\\nGrete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her.\\n“What shall we take now, then?”, said Grete and looked around. Her eyes\\nmet those of Gregor on the wall. Perhaps only because her mother was\\nthere, she remained calm, bent her face to her so that she would not\\nlook round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice:\\n“Come on, let’s go back in the living room for a while?” Gregor could\\nsee what Grete had in mind, she wanted to take her mother somewhere\\nsafe and then chase him down from the wall. Well, she could certainly\\ntry it! He sat unyielding on his picture. He would rather jump at\\nGrete’s face.\\n\\nBut Grete’s words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to one\\nside, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the\\nwallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw\\nscreamed: “Oh God, oh God!” Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch\\nas if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile. “Gregor!”\\nshouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist. That was the\\nfirst word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation. She\\nran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring\\nher mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted to help too—he could save\\nhis picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull\\nhimself off by force; then he, too, ran into the next room as if he\\ncould advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to just stand\\nbehind her doing nothing; she was looking into various bottles, he\\nstartled her when she turned round; a bottle fell to the ground and\\nbroke; a splinter cut Gregor’s face, some kind of caustic medicine\\nsplashed all over him; now, without delaying any longer, Grete took\\nhold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother;\\nshe slammed the door shut with her foot. So now Gregor was shut out\\nfrom his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death; he could\\nnot open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she\\nhad to stay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait;\\nand, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about,\\nhe crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in\\nhis confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down\\ninto the middle of the dinner table.\\n\\nHe lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was\\nquiet, maybe that was a good sign. Then there was someone at the door.\\nThe maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete\\nwould have to go and answer it. His father had arrived home. “What’s\\nhappened?” were his first words; Grete’s appearance must have made\\neverything clear to him. She answered him with subdued voice, and\\nopenly pressed her face into his chest: “Mother’s fainted, but she’s\\nbetter now. Gregor got out.” “Just as I expected”, said his father,\\n“just as I always said, but you women wouldn’t listen, would you.” It\\nwas clear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and that his father\\ntook it to mean that something bad had happened, that he was\\nresponsible for some act of violence. That meant Gregor would now have\\nto try to calm his father, as he did not have the time to explain\\nthings to him even if that had been possible. So he fled to the door of\\nhis room and pressed himself against it so that his father, when he\\ncame in from the hall, could see straight away that Gregor had the best\\nintentions and would go back into his room without delay, that it would\\nnot be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the\\ndoor and he would disappear.\\n\\nHis father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that;\\n“Ah!”, he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were both angry and\\nglad at the same time. Gregor drew his head back from the door and\\nlifted it towards his father. He really had not imagined his father the\\nway he stood there now; of late, with his new habit of crawling about,\\nhe had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the\\nflat the way he had done before. He really ought to have expected\\nthings to have changed, but still, still, was that really his father?\\nThe same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when\\nGregor came back from his business trips, who would receive him sitting\\nin the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings; who\\nwas hardly even able to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would\\njust raise his arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they\\nwent for a walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up\\ntightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always\\nlabour his way forward a little more slowly than them, who were already\\nwalking slowly for his sake; who would place his stick down carefully\\nand, if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his\\ncompanions around him. He was standing up straight enough now; dressed\\nin a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the\\nemployees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff collar of the\\ncoat his strong double-chin emerged; under the bushy eyebrows, his\\npiercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; his normally unkempt\\nwhite hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp. He took his\\ncap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in\\nan arc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his\\ntrouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and,\\nwith look of determination, walked towards Gregor. He probably did not\\neven know himself what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet\\nunusually high. Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of\\nhis boots, but wasted no time with that—he knew full well, right from\\nthe first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to\\nalways be extremely strict with him. And so he ran up to his father,\\nstopped when his father stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved,\\neven slightly. In this way they went round the room several times\\nwithout anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression\\nof a chase as everything went so slowly. Gregor remained all this time\\non the floor, largely because he feared his father might see it as\\nespecially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling. Whatever he\\ndid, Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up\\nthis running about for long, as for each step his father took he had to\\ncarry out countless movements. He became noticeably short of breath,\\neven in his earlier life his lungs had not been very reliable. Now, as\\nhe lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for\\nrunning he could hardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too\\nslow for him to think of any other way of saving himself than running;\\nhe almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although,\\nhere, they were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of\\nnotches and protrusions—then, right beside him, lightly tossed,\\nsomething flew down and rolled in front of him. It was an apple; then\\nanother one immediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was\\nno longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard\\nhim. He had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the\\nsideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw\\none apple after another. These little, red apples rolled about on the\\nfloor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors. An\\napple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor’s back and slid\\noff without doing any harm. Another one however, immediately following\\nit, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag himself\\naway, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible pain by\\nchanging his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread\\nhimself out, all his senses in confusion. The last thing he saw was the\\ndoor of his room being pulled open, his sister was screaming, his\\nmother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as his sister had taken\\noff some of her clothes after she had fainted to make it easier for her\\nto breathe), she ran to his father, her skirts unfastened and sliding\\none after another to the ground, stumbling over the skirts she pushed\\nherself to his father, her arms around him, uniting herself with him\\ntotally—now Gregor lost his ability to see anything—her hands behind\\nhis father’s head begging him to spare Gregor’s life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\n\\nNo-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor’s flesh, so it\\nremained there as a visible reminder of his injury. He had suffered it\\nthere for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious enough to\\nremind even his father that Gregor, despite his current sad and\\nrevolting form, was a family member who could not be treated as an\\nenemy. On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to swallow any\\nrevulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.\\n\\nBecause of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility—probably\\npermanently. He had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid\\nand it took him long, long minutes to crawl across his room—crawling\\nover the ceiling was out of the question—but this deterioration in his\\ncondition was fully (in his opinion) made up for by the door to the\\nliving room being left open every evening. He got into the habit of\\nclosely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then,\\nlying in the darkness of his room where he could not be seen from the\\nliving room, he could watch the family in the light of the dinner table\\nand listen to their conversation—with everyone’s permission, in a way,\\nand thus quite differently from before.\\n\\nThey no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of\\ncourse, the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing when he\\nwas tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room. All\\nof them were usually very quiet nowadays. Soon after dinner, his father\\nwould go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each\\nother to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew\\nfancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, who had taken a sales\\njob, learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that she might be\\nable to get a better position later on. Sometimes his father would wake\\nup and say to Gregor’s mother “you’re doing so much sewing again\\ntoday!”, as if he did not know that he had been dozing—and then he\\nwould go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a\\ntired grin.\\n\\nWith a kind of stubbornness, Gregor’s father refused to take his\\nuniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg\\nGregor’s father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if always\\nready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even\\nhere. The uniform had not been new to start with, but as a result of\\nthis it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of Gregor’s\\nmother and sister to look after it. Gregor would often spend the whole\\nevening looking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons\\nalways kept polished and shiny, while the old man in it would sleep,\\nhighly uncomfortable but peaceful.\\n\\nAs soon as it struck ten, Gregor’s mother would speak gently to his\\nfather to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn’t\\nsleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he\\nwas to be up at six to get to work. But since he had been in work he\\nhad become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at\\nthe table, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder\\nthan ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed. Then,\\nhowever much mother and sister would importune him with little\\nreproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a\\nquarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up.\\nGregor’s mother would tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his\\near, Gregor’s sister would leave her work to help her mother, but\\nnothing would have any effect on him. He would just sink deeper into\\nhis chair. Only when the two women took him under the arms he would\\nabruptly open his eyes, look at them one after the other and say: “What\\na life! This is what peace I get in my old age!” And supported by the\\ntwo women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the\\ngreatest load himself, let the women take him to the door, send them\\noff and carry on by himself while Gregor’s mother would throw down her\\nneedle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father\\nand continue being of help to him.\\n\\nWho, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to give\\nmore attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary? The household\\nbudget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed; an enormous,\\nthick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came\\nevery morning and evening to do the heaviest work; everything else was\\nlooked after by Gregor’s mother on top of the large amount of sewing\\nwork she did. Gregor even learned, listening to the evening\\nconversation about what price they had hoped for, that several items of\\njewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even though both\\nmother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and\\ncelebrations. But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was\\nmuch too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out\\nof it, there was no imaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new\\naddress. He could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons\\nthan consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it\\nwould have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with\\na few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family back from\\ntheir decision to move was much more to do with their total despair,\\nand the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike\\nanything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to. They\\ncarried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor\\npeople, Gregor’s father brought bank employees their breakfast, his\\nmother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers, his sister\\nran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers, but\\nthey just did not have the strength to do any more. And the injury in\\nGregor’s back began to hurt as much as when it was new. After they had\\ncome back from taking his father to bed Gregor’s mother and sister\\nwould now leave their work where it was and sit close together, cheek\\nto cheek; his mother would point to Gregor’s room and say “Close that\\ndoor, Grete”, and then, when he was in the dark again, they would sit\\nin the next room and their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit\\nthere staring dry-eyed at the table.\\n\\nGregor hardly slept at all, either night or day. Sometimes he would\\nthink of taking over the family’s affairs, just like before, the next\\ntime the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss and the\\nchief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts, the salesmen\\nand the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from\\nother businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel, a\\ntender memory that appeared and disappeared again, a cashier from a hat\\nshop for whom his attention had been serious but too slow,—all of them\\nappeared to him, mixed together with strangers and others he had\\nforgotten, but instead of helping him and his family they were all of\\nthem inaccessible, and he was glad when they disappeared. Other times\\nhe was not at all in the mood to look after his family, he was filled\\nwith simple rage about the lack of attention he was shown, and although\\nhe could think of nothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he\\ncould get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was\\nentitled to, even if he was not hungry. Gregor’s sister no longer\\nthought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some\\nfood or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work\\nin the morning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it\\naway again with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten\\nor—more often than not—had been left totally untouched. She still\\ncleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been any\\nquicker about it. Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there\\nwere little balls of dust and filth. At first, Gregor went into one of\\nthe worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her,\\nbut he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing\\nanything about it; she could see the dirt as well as he could but she\\nhad simply decided to leave him to it. At the same time she became\\ntouchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the\\nfamily understood—cleaning up Gregor’s room was for her and her alone.\\nGregor’s mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use\\nseveral bucketfuls of water to do it—although that much dampness also\\nmade Gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile. But\\nhis mother was to be punished still more for what she had done, as\\nhardly had his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the\\nchange in Gregor’s room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living\\nroom where, despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, she broke\\ninto convulsive tears. Her father, of course, was startled out of his\\nchair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless; then they,\\ntoo, became agitated; Gregor’s father, standing to the right of his\\nmother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning of Gregor’s room to his\\nsister; from her left, Gregor’s sister screamed at her that she was\\nnever to clean Gregor’s room again; while his mother tried to draw his\\nfather, who was beside himself with anger, into the bedroom; his\\nsister, quaking with tears, thumped on the table with her small fists;\\nand Gregor hissed in anger that no-one had even thought of closing the\\ndoor to save him the sight of this and all its noise.\\n\\nGregor’s sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after\\nGregor as she had done before was even more work for her, but even so\\nhis mother ought certainly not to have taken her place. Gregor, on the\\nother hand, ought not to be neglected. Now, though, the charwoman was\\nhere. This elderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made her\\nable to withstand the hardest of things in her long life, wasn’t really\\nrepelled by Gregor. Just by chance one day, rather than any real\\ncuriosity, she opened the door to Gregor’s room and found herself face\\nto face with him. He was taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing\\nhim but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in\\namazement with her hands crossed in front of her. From then on she\\nnever failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and\\nlook briefly in on him. At first she would call to him as she did so\\nwith words that she probably considered friendly, such as “come on\\nthen, you old dung-beetle!”, or “look at the old dung-beetle there!”\\nGregor never responded to being spoken to in that way, but just\\nremained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been\\nopened. If only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every\\nday instead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt\\nlike it! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the\\nwindowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began to\\nspeak to him in that way once again. Gregor was so resentful of it that\\nhe started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but it was like\\na kind of attack. Instead of being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up\\none of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth\\nopen, clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her\\nhand had been slammed down into Gregor’s back. “Aren’t you coming any\\ncloser, then?”, she asked when Gregor turned round again, and she\\ncalmly put the chair back in the corner.\\n\\nGregor had almost entirely stopped eating. Only if he happened to find\\nhimself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take\\nsome of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours\\nand then, more often than not, spit it out again. At first he thought\\nit was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating, but\\nhe had soon got used to the changes made there. They had got into the\\nhabit of putting things into this room that they had no room for\\nanywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms\\nin the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnest\\ngentlemen—all three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering\\nthrough the crack in the door one day—were painfully insistent on\\nthings’ being tidy. This meant not only in their own room but, since\\nthey had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and\\nespecially in the kitchen. Unnecessary clutter was something they could\\nnot tolerate, especially if it was dirty. They had moreover brought\\nmost of their own furnishings and equipment with them. For this reason,\\nmany things had become superfluous which, although they could not be\\nsold, the family did not wish to discard. All these things found their\\nway into Gregor’s room. The dustbins from the kitchen found their way\\nin there too. The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything she\\ncouldn’t use for the time being she would just chuck in there. He,\\nfortunately, would usually see no more than the object and the hand\\nthat held it. The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out\\nagain when she had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out\\nin one go, but what actually happened was that they were left where\\nthey landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way\\nthrough the junk and moved it somewhere else. At first he moved it\\nbecause, with no other room free where he could crawl about, he was\\nforced to, but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in\\nthat way left him sad and tired to death, and he would remain immobile\\nfor hours afterwards.\\n\\nThe gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening\\nmeal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the\\ndoor to this room was often kept closed in the evening. But Gregor\\nfound it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after all, often\\nfailed to make use of it when it was open and, without the family\\nhaving noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner. One time,\\nthough, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open,\\nand it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in\\nthe evening and the light was put on. They sat up at the table where,\\nformerly, Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother, they\\nunfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks. Gregor’s\\nmother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon\\nbehind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes. The\\nfood was steaming, and filled the room with its smell. The gentlemen\\nbent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the\\nfood before eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to\\ncount as an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of\\nmeat while it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish\\nwhether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to\\nthe kitchen. It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor’s mother and\\nsister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again and\\nsmiled.\\n\\nThe family themselves ate in the kitchen. Nonetheless, Gregor’s father\\ncame into the living room before he went into the kitchen, bowed once\\nwith his cap in his hand and did his round of the table. The gentlemen\\nstood as one, and mumbled something into their beards. Then, once they\\nwere alone, they ate in near perfect silence. It seemed remarkable to\\nGregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth\\ncould still be heard, as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you\\nneed teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything\\nwith jaws that are toothless however nice they might be. “I’d like to\\neat something”, said Gregor anxiously, “but not anything like they’re\\neating. They do feed themselves. And here I am, dying!”\\n\\nThroughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the\\nviolin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the\\nkitchen. The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one\\nin the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the\\nothers, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and\\nsmoking. When the violin began playing they became attentive, stood up\\nand went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they stood\\npressed against each other. Someone must have heard them in the\\nkitchen, as Gregor’s father called out: “Is the playing perhaps\\nunpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away.” “On the\\ncontrary”, said the middle gentleman, “would the young lady not like to\\ncome in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after all, much\\nmore cosy and comfortable?” “Oh yes, we’d love to”, called back\\nGregor’s father as if he had been the violin player himself. The\\ngentlemen stepped back into the room and waited. Gregor’s father soon\\nappeared with the music stand, his mother with the music and his sister\\nwith the violin. She calmly prepared everything for her to begin\\nplaying; his parents, who had never rented a room out before and\\ntherefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen,\\ndid not even dare to sit on their own chairs; his father leant against\\nthe door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his\\nuniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the\\ngentlemen and sat—leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to\\nhave placed it—out of the way in a corner.\\n\\nHis sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention, one\\non each side, to the movements of her hands. Drawn in by the playing,\\nGregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in\\nthe living room. Before, he had taken great pride in how considerate he\\nwas but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless\\nabout the others. What’s more, there was now all the more reason to\\nkeep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust that lay everywhere\\nin his room and flew up at the slightest movement; he carried threads,\\nhairs, and remains of food about on his back and sides; he was much too\\nindifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on\\nthe carpet like he had used to do several times a day. And despite this\\ncondition, he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the\\nimmaculate floor of the living room.\\n\\nNo-one noticed him, though. The family was totally preoccupied with the\\nviolin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put their hands in\\ntheir pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look\\nat all the notes being played, and they must have disturbed Gregor’s\\nsister, but soon, in contrast with the family, they withdrew back to\\nthe window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half\\nvolume, and they stayed by the window while Gregor’s father observed\\nthem anxiously. It really now seemed very obvious that they had\\nexpected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had\\nbeen disappointed, that they had had enough of the whole performance\\nand it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to\\nbe disturbed. It was especially unnerving, the way they all blew the\\nsmoke from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses. Yet\\nGregor’s sister was playing so beautifully. Her face was leant to one\\nside, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy\\nexpression. Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his head\\nclose to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came.\\nWas he an animal if music could captivate him so? It seemed to him that\\nhe was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been\\nyearning for. He was determined to make his way forward to his sister\\nand tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her\\nviolin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He\\nnever wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway;\\nhis shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he\\nwanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the\\nattackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though,\\nbut stay of her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch\\nwith her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always\\nintended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told\\neveryone about it last Christmas—had Christmas really come and gone\\nalready?—if this misfortune hadn’t got in the way, and refuse to let\\nanyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would\\nbreak out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her\\nshoulder and kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to\\nwork, she had kept free without any necklace or collar.\\n\\n“Mr. Samsa!”, shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor’s father,\\npointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at Gregor\\nas he slowly moved forward. The violin went silent, the middle of the\\nthree gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and\\nthen looked back at Gregor. His father seemed to think it more\\nimportant to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even\\nthough they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more\\nentertaining than the violin playing had been. He rushed up to them\\nwith his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their\\nroom at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his\\nbody. Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear\\nwhether it was his father’s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning\\nrealisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room\\nwithout knowing it. They asked Gregor’s father for explanations, raised\\ntheir arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back\\ntowards their room only very slowly. Meanwhile Gregor’s sister had\\novercome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly\\ninterrupted. She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang\\nlimply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still\\nplaying, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay the\\ninstrument on her mother’s lap who still sat laboriously struggling for\\nbreath where she was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure\\nfrom her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward.\\nUnder his sister’s experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds\\nflew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the\\nbeds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the\\nroom. Gregor’s father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he\\nforgot all the respect he owed to his tenants. He urged them and\\npressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the\\nmiddle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot\\nand thereby brought Gregor’s father to a halt. “I declare here and\\nnow”, he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor’s mother and\\nsister to gain their attention too, “that with regard to the repugnant\\nconditions that prevail in this flat and with this family”—here he\\nlooked briefly but decisively at the floor—“I give immediate notice on\\nmy room. For the days that I have been living here I will, of course,\\npay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed\\nwith some kind of action for damages from you, and believe me it would\\nbe very easy to set out the grounds for such an action.” He was silent\\nand looked straight ahead as if waiting for something. And indeed, his\\ntwo friends joined in with the words: “And we also give immediate\\nnotice.” With that, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the\\ndoor.\\n\\nGregor’s father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his\\nhands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out\\nfor his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept\\nnodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all. Throughout\\nall this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first\\nseen him. His disappointment at the failure of his plan, and perhaps\\nalso because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible for him to\\nmove. He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he\\nwaited. He was not even startled out of this state when the violin on\\nhis mother’s lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on\\nthe floor.\\n\\n“Father, Mother”, said his sister, hitting the table with her hand as\\nintroduction, “we can’t carry on like this. Maybe you can’t see it, but\\nI can. I don’t want to call this monster my brother, all I can say is:\\nwe have to try and get rid of it. We’ve done all that’s humanly\\npossible to look after it and be patient, I don’t think anyone could\\naccuse us of doing anything wrong.”\\n\\n“She’s absolutely right”, said Gregor’s father to himself. His mother,\\nwho still had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough dully,\\nher hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her\\neyes.\\n\\nGregor’s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead.\\nHer words seemed to give Gregor’s father some more definite ideas. He\\nsat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the\\nthree gentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked down at\\nGregor as he lay there immobile.\\n\\n“We have to try and get rid of it”, said Gregor’s sister, now speaking\\nonly to her father, as her mother was too occupied with coughing to\\nlisten, “it’ll be the death of both of you, I can see it coming. We\\ncan’t all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured\\nlike this, we can’t endure it. I can’t endure it any more.” And she\\nbroke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her\\nmother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements.\\n\\n“My child”, said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding,\\n“what are we to do?”\\n\\nHis sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness\\nand tears that had taken hold of her, displacing her earlier certainty.\\n\\n“If he could just understand us”, said his father almost as a question;\\nhis sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as a sign that\\nof that there was no question.\\n\\n“If he could just understand us”, repeated Gregor’s father, closing his\\neyes in acceptance of his sister’s certainty that that was quite\\nimpossible, “then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement\\nwith him. But as it is ...”\\n\\n“It’s got to go”, shouted his sister, “that’s the only way, Father.\\nYou’ve got to get rid of the idea that that’s Gregor. We’ve only harmed\\nourselves by believing it for so long. How can that be Gregor? If it\\nwere Gregor he would have seen long ago that it’s not possible for\\nhuman beings to live with an animal like that and he would have gone of\\nhis own free will. We wouldn’t have a brother any more, then, but we\\ncould carry on with our lives and remember him with respect. As it is\\nthis animal is persecuting us, it’s driven out our tenants, it\\nobviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on\\nthe streets. Father, look, just look”, she suddenly screamed, “he’s\\nstarting again!” In her alarm, which was totally beyond Gregor’s\\ncomprehension, his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed\\nherself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her\\nown mother than stay anywhere near Gregor. She rushed over to behind\\nher father, who had become excited merely because she was and stood up\\nhalf raising his hands in front of Gregor’s sister as if to protect\\nher.\\n\\nBut Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his\\nsister. All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go\\nback into his room, although that was in itself quite startling as his\\npain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal\\nof effort and he was using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly\\nraising it and striking it against the floor. He stopped and looked\\nround. They seemed to have realised his good intention and had only\\nbeen alarmed briefly. Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence.\\nHis mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed\\nagainst each other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister\\nsat next to his father with her arms around his neck.\\n\\n“Maybe now they’ll let me turn round”, thought Gregor and went back to\\nwork. He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had\\nsometimes to stop and take a rest. No-one was making him rush any more,\\neverything was left up to him. As soon as he had finally finished\\nturning round he began to move straight ahead. He was amazed at the\\ngreat distance that separated him from his room, and could not\\nunderstand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little\\nwhile before and almost without noticing it. He concentrated on\\ncrawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a\\nword, not any cry, from his family to distract him. He did not turn his\\nhead until he had reached the doorway. He did not turn it all the way\\nround as he felt his neck becoming stiff, but it was nonetheless enough\\nto see that nothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood\\nup. With his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen\\ncompletely asleep.\\n\\nHe was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut,\\nbolted and locked. The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that\\nhis little legs collapsed under him. It was his sister who had been in\\nso much of a rush. She had been standing there waiting and sprung\\nforward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, and as she\\nturned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents “At last!”.\\n\\n“What now, then?”, Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the\\ndarkness. He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at\\nall. This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being able to\\nactually move around on those spindly little legs until then was\\nunnatural. He also felt relatively comfortable. It is true that his\\nentire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker\\nand weaker and would finally disappear altogether. He could already\\nhardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around\\nit, which was entirely covered in white dust. He thought back of his\\nfamily with emotion and love. If it was possible, he felt that he must\\ngo away even more strongly than his sister. He remained in this state\\nof empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike\\nthree in the morning. He watched as it slowly began to get light\\neverywhere outside the window too. Then, without his willing it, his\\nhead sank down completely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his\\nnostrils.\\n\\nWhen the cleaner came in early in the morning—they’d often asked her\\nnot to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her hurry\\nshe still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she’d arrived and\\nfrom then on it was impossible to sleep in peace—she made her usual\\nbrief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing special. She thought\\nhe was laying there so still on purpose, playing the martyr; she\\nattributed all possible understanding to him. She happened to be\\nholding the long broom in her hand, so she tried to tickle Gregor with\\nit from the doorway. When she had no success with that she tried to\\nmake a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little, and only when she\\nfound she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all\\ndid she start to pay attention. She soon realised what had really\\nhappened, opened her eyes wide, whistled to herself, but did not waste\\ntime to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness\\nof the bedrooms: “Come and ’ave a look at this, it’s dead, just lying\\nthere, stone dead!”\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to\\nmake an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they\\ncould grasp what she was saying. But then, each from his own side, they\\nhurried out of bed. Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders,\\nMrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress; and that is how they went\\ninto Gregor’s room. On the way they opened the door to the living room\\nwhere Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in;\\nshe was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep, and the paleness\\nof her face seemed to confirm this. “Dead?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, looking\\nat the charwoman enquiringly, even though she could have checked for\\nherself and could have known it even without checking. “That’s what I\\nsaid”, replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor’s body\\nanother shove with the broom, sending it sideways across the floor.\\nMrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but\\ndid not complete it. “Now then”, said Mr. Samsa, “let’s give thanks to\\nGod for that”. He crossed himself, and the three women followed his\\nexample. Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: “Just\\nlook how thin he was. He didn’t eat anything for so long. The food came\\nout again just the same as when it went in”. Gregor’s body was indeed\\ncompletely dried up and flat, they had not seen it until then, but now\\nhe was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make\\nthem look away.\\n\\n“Grete, come with us in here for a little while”, said Mrs. Samsa with\\na pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not\\nwithout looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened\\nthe window wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh\\nair had something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of\\nMarch, after all.\\n\\nThe three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in\\namazement for their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about. “Where\\nis our breakfast?”, the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably.\\nShe just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to\\nthe men that they might like to come into Gregor’s room. They did so,\\nand stood around Gregor’s corpse with their hands in the pockets of\\ntheir well-worn coats. It was now quite light in the room.\\n\\nThen the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared in his\\nuniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. All of\\nthem had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her face\\nagainst her father’s arm.\\n\\n“Leave my home. Now!”, said Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and without\\nletting the women from him. “What do you mean?”, asked the middle of\\nthe three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled sweetly. The\\nother two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed\\nthem together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could\\nonly end in their favour. “I mean just what I said”, answered Mr.\\nSamsa, and, with his two companions, went in a straight line towards\\nthe man. At first, he stood there still, looking at the ground as if\\nthe contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new\\npositions. “Alright, we’ll go then”, he said, and looked up at Mr.\\nSamsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted\\npermission again from Mr. Samsa for his decision. Mr. Samsa merely\\nopened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times. At that,\\nand without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the\\nfront hallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some\\ntime before and had been listening to what was being said. Now they\\njumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr.\\nSamsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the\\nconnection with their leader. Once there, all three took their hats\\nfrom the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without a word\\nand left the premises. Mr. Samsa and the two women followed them out\\nonto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust the men’s\\nintentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three\\ngentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps. As they\\nturned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a\\nfew moments later; the further down they went, the more that the Samsa\\nfamily lost interest in them; when a butcher’s boy, proud of posture\\nwith his tray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer\\nthan they were, Mr. Samsa and the women came away from the landing and\\nwent, as if relieved, back into the flat.\\n\\nThey decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation\\nand to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but\\nthey were in serious need of it. So they sat at the table and wrote\\nthree letters of excusal, Mr. Samsa to his employers, Mrs. Samsa to her\\ncontractor and Grete to her principal. The cleaner came in while they\\nwere writing to tell them she was going, she’d finished her work for\\nthat morning. The three of them at first just nodded without looking up\\nfrom what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did\\nnot seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation. “Well?”,\\nasked Mr. Samsa. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her\\nface as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only\\ndo it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical little ostrich\\nfeather on her hat, which had been a source of irritation to Mr. Samsa\\nall the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all\\ndirections. “What is it you want then?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the\\ncleaner had the most respect for. “Yes”, she answered, and broke into a\\nfriendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, “well then,\\nthat thing in there, you needn’t worry about how you’re going to get\\nrid of it. That’s all been sorted out.” Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down\\nover their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were\\nwriting; Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing\\neverything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite\\nclear that she was not to. So, as she was prevented from telling them\\nall about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and,\\nclearly peeved, called out “Cheerio then, everyone”, turned round\\nsharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.\\n\\n“Tonight she gets sacked”, said Mr. Samsa, but he received no reply\\nfrom either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have\\ndestroyed the peace they had only just gained. They got up and went\\nover to the window where they remained with their arms around each\\nother. Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat\\nthere watching for a while. Then he called out: “Come here, then. Let’s\\nforget about all that old stuff, shall we. Come and give me a bit of\\nattention”. The two women immediately did as he said, hurrying over to\\nhim where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished\\ntheir letters.\\n\\nAfter that, the three of them left the flat together, which was\\nsomething they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the\\nopen country outside the town. They had the tram, filled with warm\\nsunshine, all to themselves. Leant back comfortably on their seats,\\nthey discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination\\nthey were not at all bad—until then they had never asked each other\\nabout their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held\\nparticularly good promise for the future. The greatest improvement for\\nthe time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving\\nhouse; what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper\\nthan the current one which had been chosen by Gregor, one that was in a\\nbetter location and, most of all, more practical. All the time, Grete\\nwas becoming livelier. With all the worry they had been having of late\\nher cheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking, Mr. and Mrs.\\nSamsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their\\ndaughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.\\nThey became quieter. Just from each other’s glance and almost without\\nknowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man\\nfor her. And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good\\nintentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the\\nfirst to get up and stretch out her young body.\\n'"

       "'CHAPTER I.\\nDown the Rabbit-Hole\\n\\n\\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\\nconversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice\\n“without pictures or conversations?”\\n\\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\\nclose by her.\\n\\nThere was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\\nso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh\\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,\\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\\n\\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\\nin the world she was to get out again.\\n\\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\\ndeep well.\\n\\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\\npassed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great\\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\\ncupboards as she fell past it.\\n\\n“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall\\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me\\nat home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\\ntop of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)\\n\\nDown, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how\\nmany miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be\\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\\nbe four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt\\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\\npractice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but\\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no\\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\\ngrand words to say.)\\n\\nPresently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\\nthe earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather\\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all\\nthe right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”\\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re\\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what\\nan ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do\\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\\n\\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\\ntalking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”\\n(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\\nno mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s\\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here\\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\\ndreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and\\nsometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer\\neither question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt\\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\\n“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,\\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\\nthe fall was over.\\n\\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\\nit. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\\nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears\\nand whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she\\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\\nfrom the roof.\\n\\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\\nget out again.\\n\\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s\\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\\nbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\\n\\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\\npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\\nout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\\nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\\nthrough the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought\\npoor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\\nhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\\nknew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\\nhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\\nindeed were really impossible.\\n\\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\\ntime she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here\\nbefore,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\\nlabel, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large\\nletters.\\n\\nIt was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was\\nnot going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,\\n“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read\\nseveral nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\\neaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\\n_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\\nsuch as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\\nand that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\\nbleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\\nbottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,\\nsooner or later.\\n\\nHowever, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to\\ntaste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\\nflavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\\nhot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n\\n“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a\\ntelescope.”\\n\\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\\nshe felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”\\nsaid Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I\\nwonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the\\nflame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\\nnot remember ever having seen such a thing.\\n\\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\\nsat down and cried.\\n\\n“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,\\nrather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally\\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\\n“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two\\npeople! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\\nperson!”\\n\\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\\n“EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said\\nAlice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll\\nget into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”\\n\\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which\\nway?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\\non in the common way.\\n\\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\nThe Pool of Tears\\n\\n\\n“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m\\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!”\\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\\nsight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I\\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m\\nsure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be\\nkind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I\\nwant to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every\\nChristmas.”\\n\\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must\\ngo by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending\\npresents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\\n\\n     _Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\\n     Alice’s love_).\\n\\nOh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”\\n\\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.\\n\\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\\n\\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like\\nyou,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop\\nthis moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding\\ngallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\\nfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\\n\\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the\\nDuchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt\\nso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\\nRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,\\nsir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\\nthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\\n\\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How\\nqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\\nI wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling\\na little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who\\nin the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began\\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\\n\\n“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long\\nringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t\\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\\nvery little! Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how\\npuzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.\\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\\nand four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\\nrate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try\\nGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\\nRome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been\\nchanged for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she\\ncrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\\nto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\\ndid not come the same as they used to do:—\\n\\n“How doth the little crocodile\\n    Improve his shining tail,\\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\\n    On every golden scale!\\n\\n“How cheerfully he seems to grin,\\n    How neatly spread his claws,\\nAnd welcome little fishes in\\n    With gently smiling jaws!”\\n\\n\\n“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes\\nfilled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and\\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve\\nmade up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be\\nno use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’\\nI shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\\nthen, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down\\nhere till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden\\nburst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so\\n_very_ tired of being all alone here!”\\n\\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while\\nshe was talking. “How _can_ I have done that?” she thought. “I must be\\ngrowing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure\\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\\nfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\\ndropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\\n\\n“That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and\\nnow for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little\\ndoor: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\\nkey was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than\\never,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this\\nbefore, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”\\n\\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\\nsplash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that\\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by\\nrailway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\\nshe was nine feet high.\\n\\n“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying\\nto find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\\nsure! However, everything is queer to-day.”\\n\\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\\nslipped in like herself.\\n\\n“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?\\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she\\nbegan: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right\\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\\nshe remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of\\na mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather\\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\\nbut it said nothing.\\n\\n“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s\\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all\\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\\nanything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which\\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\\nfright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\\nhad hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like\\ncats.”\\n\\n“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would\\n_you_ like cats if you were me?”\\n\\n“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry\\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d\\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\\nquiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\\nin the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\\npaws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\\nnurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your\\npardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk\\nabout her any more if you’d rather not.”\\n\\n“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\\ntail. “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always\\n_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name\\nagain!”\\n\\n“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\\nconversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not\\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near\\nour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when\\nyou throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\\nof things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you\\nknow, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says\\nit kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\\n“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away\\nfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\\npool as it went.\\n\\nSo she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\\nwon’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the\\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\\nwas quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\\ntrembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my\\nhistory, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”\\n\\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\\nDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice\\nled the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\nA Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\\n\\n\\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the\\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\\nto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\\n\\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\\nnatural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\\nshe had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument\\nwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am\\nolder than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow\\nwithout knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\\ntell its age, there was no more to be said.\\n\\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\\ncalled out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make\\nyou dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\\nMouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she\\nfelt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\\n\\n“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This\\nis the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William\\nthe Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\\nto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\\naccustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\\nMercia and Northumbria—’”\\n\\n“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.\\n\\n“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did\\nyou speak?”\\n\\n“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.\\n\\n“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar,\\nthe earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even\\nStigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”\\n\\n“Found _what_?” said the Duck.\\n\\n“Found _it_,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know\\nwhat ‘it’ means.”\\n\\n“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the\\nDuck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\\narchbishop find?”\\n\\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found\\nit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him\\nthe crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence\\nof his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,\\nturning to Alice as it spoke.\\n\\n“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to\\ndry me at all.”\\n\\n“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move\\nthat the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\\nremedies—”\\n\\n“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half\\nthose long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And\\nthe Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\\ntittered audibly.\\n\\n“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,\\nthat the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”\\n\\n“What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to\\nknow, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to\\nspeak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\\n\\n“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,\\nas you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will\\ntell you how the Dodo managed it.)\\n\\nFirst it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact\\nshape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed\\nalong the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and\\naway,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\\nagain, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all\\ncrowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”\\n\\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\\nthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\\nforehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\\npictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\\nsaid, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”\\n\\n“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.\\n\\n“Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\\nfinger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\\nconfused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”\\n\\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\\nnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly\\none a-piece, all round.\\n\\n“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.\\n\\n“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in\\nyour pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.\\n\\n“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.\\n\\n“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.\\n\\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\\npresented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant\\nthimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all\\ncheered.\\n\\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\\nthat she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\\nto say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as\\nshe could.\\n\\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\\ntheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\\nHowever, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\\nbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.\\n\\n“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why\\nit is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\\nwould be offended again.\\n\\n“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\\nsighing.\\n\\n“It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder\\nat the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on\\npuzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the\\ntale was something like this:—\\n\\n         “Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both\\n         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no\\n         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve\\n         nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear\\n         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’\\n         ‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll\\n         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”\\n\\n“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are\\nyou thinking of?”\\n\\n“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth\\nbend, I think?”\\n\\n“I had _not!_” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\\n\\n“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\\nanxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”\\n\\n“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and\\nwalking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”\\n\\n“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily offended,\\nyou know!”\\n\\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.\\n\\n“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and\\nthe others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only\\nshook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\\n\\n“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was\\nquite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to\\nher daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\\n_your_ temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little\\nsnappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”\\n\\n“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,\\naddressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”\\n\\n“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the\\nLory.\\n\\nAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\\n“Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you\\ncan’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\\nshe’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”\\n\\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\\nbirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\\ncarefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air\\ndoesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice\\nto its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in\\nbed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left\\nalone.\\n\\n“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy\\ntone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best\\ncat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\\nany more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\\nlonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a\\nlittle pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\\neagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was\\ncoming back to finish his story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\nThe Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\\n\\n\\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\\nit muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\\nmy fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\\nferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a\\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\\ngloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\\nthey were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since\\nher swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the\\nlittle door, had vanished completely.\\n\\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\\ncalled out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you\\ndoing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\\na fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\\nat once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\\nmistake it had made.\\n\\n“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How\\nsurprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him\\nhis fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she\\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\\nplate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without\\nknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\\nreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\\nfan and gloves.\\n\\n“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for\\na rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she\\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come\\nhere directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,\\nnurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I\\ndon’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house\\nif it began ordering people about like that!”\\n\\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\\npairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\\ngloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\\nlittle bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\\nthis time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it\\nand put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to\\nhappen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so\\nI’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large\\nagain, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”\\n\\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\\ndown the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t\\ngrow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t\\ndrunk quite so much!”\\n\\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\\nwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\\none elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\\nStill she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\\nof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I\\ncan do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”\\n\\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\\nand she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\\nseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\\nagain, no wonder she felt unhappy.\\n\\n“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t\\nalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\\nrabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and\\nyet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\\n_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\\nthat kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\\none! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\\nwhen I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a\\nsorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”\\n\\n“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am\\nnow? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but\\nthen—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”\\n\\n“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn\\nlessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all\\nfor any lesson-books!”\\n\\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\\nmaking quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\\nshe heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\\n\\n“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!”\\nThen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\\nthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\\nlarge as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\\n\\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\\nthe door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,\\nthat attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll\\ngo round and get in at the window.”\\n\\n“_That_ you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\\nhand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\\ncucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\\n\\nNext came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And\\nthen a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging\\nfor apples, yer honour!”\\n\\n“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and\\nhelp me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)\\n\\n“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”\\n\\n“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)\\n\\n“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\\nwindow!”\\n\\n“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”\\n\\n“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”\\n\\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\\nnow and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at\\nall!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her\\nhand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\\n_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number\\nof cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what\\nthey’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\\n_could!_ I’m sure _I_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!”\\n\\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\\nrumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\\ntalking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other\\nladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill!\\nfetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em\\ntogether first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do\\nwell enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this\\nrope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down!\\nHeads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I\\nfancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t! _You_ do\\nit!—_That_ I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says\\nyou’re to go down the chimney!”\\n\\n“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to\\nherself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in\\nBill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\\nI _think_ I can kick a little!”\\n\\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\\nshe heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)\\nscratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\\nsaying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited\\nto see what would happen next.\\n\\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”\\nthen the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then\\nsilence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy\\nnow—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\\nus all about it!”\\n\\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought\\nAlice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m\\na deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me\\nlike a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”\\n\\n“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.\\n\\n“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice\\ncalled out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”\\n\\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I\\nwonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the\\nroof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\\nAlice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”\\n\\n“A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\\nwindow, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to\\nthis,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that\\nagain!” which produced another dead silence.\\n\\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\\nlittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\\nhead. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make\\n_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it\\nmust make me smaller, I suppose.”\\n\\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\\nbegan shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\\nthrough the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\\nlittle animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\\nwas in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\\nsomething out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\\nappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\\nsafe in a thick wood.\\n\\n“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she\\nwandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the\\nsecond thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that\\nwill be the best plan.”\\n\\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\\narranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\\nhow to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\\nthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\\ngreat hurry.\\n\\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little\\nthing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\\nit; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\\nmight be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\\nspite of all her coaxing.\\n\\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\\nheld it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\\nall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\\nand made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\\nto keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\\nother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\\nover heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\\nvery like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\\n\\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\\nset off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\\nand till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\\n\\n“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant\\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\\nleaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d\\nonly been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that\\nI’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? I\\nsuppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\\nquestion is, what?”\\n\\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\\nThere was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\\nherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\\nbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\\nwas on the top of it.\\n\\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\\ncaterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\\nsmoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of\\nanything else.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\nAdvice from a Caterpillar\\n\\n\\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\\n\\n“Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\\nrather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know\\nwho I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\\nchanged several times since then.”\\n\\n“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain\\nyourself!”\\n\\n“I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m\\nnot myself, you see.”\\n\\n“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely,\\n“for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.”\\n\\n“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you\\nhave to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then\\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little\\nqueer, won’t you?”\\n\\n“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know\\nis, it would feel very queer to _me_.”\\n\\n“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are _you?_”\\n\\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\\nAlice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_\\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I\\nthink, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”\\n\\n“Why?” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\\ngood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\\nstate of mind, she turned away.\\n\\n“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something\\nimportant to say!”\\n\\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\\n\\n“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\\ncould.\\n\\n“No,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\\nand perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For\\nsome minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\\nits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you\\nthink you’re changed, do you?”\\n\\n“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I\\nused—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”\\n\\n“Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all\\ncame different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\\n\\n“Repeat, “_You are old, Father William_,’” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nAlice folded her hands, and began:—\\n\\n“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,\\n    “And your hair has become very white;\\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head—\\n    Do you think, at your age, it is right?”\\n\\n“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,\\n    “I feared it might injure the brain;\\nBut, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,\\n    Why, I do it again and again.”\\n\\n“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,\\n    And have grown most uncommonly fat;\\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—\\n    Pray, what is the reason of that?”\\n\\n“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\\n    “I kept all my limbs very supple\\nBy the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—\\n    Allow me to sell you a couple?”\\n\\n“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak\\n    For anything tougher than suet;\\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—\\n    Pray, how did you manage to do it?”\\n\\n“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,\\n    And argued each case with my wife;\\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\\n    Has lasted the rest of my life.”\\n\\n“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose\\n    That your eye was as steady as ever;\\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—\\n    What made you so awfully clever?”\\n\\n“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”\\n    Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!\\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\\n    Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”\\n\\n\\n“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Not _quite_ right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the\\nwords have got altered.”\\n\\n“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly,\\nand there was silence for some minutes.\\n\\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\\n\\n“What size do you want to be?” it asked.\\n\\n“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one\\ndoesn’t like changing so often, you know.”\\n\\n“I _don’t_ know,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\\nbefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\\n\\n“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn’t\\nmind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”\\n\\n“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily,\\nrearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\\n\\n“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she\\nthought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily\\noffended!”\\n\\n“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the\\nhookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\\n\\nThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\\nminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\\nyawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\\nmushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\\n“One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\\ngrow shorter.”\\n\\n“One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_” thought Alice to\\nherself.\\n\\n“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\\naloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\\n\\nAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\\ntrying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was\\nperfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at\\nlast she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\\noff a bit of the edge with each hand.\\n\\n“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\\nviolent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\\n\\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\\nso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\\nmouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\\nlefthand bit.\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n\\n“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which\\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\\nan immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\\nsea of green leaves that lay far below her.\\n\\n“What _can_ all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where _have_ my\\nshoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?”\\nShe was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\\n\\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\\nshe tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\\nher neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She\\nhad just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\\ngoing to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\\nthe tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\\nhiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\\nface, and was beating her violently with its wings.\\n\\n“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.\\n\\n“I’m _not_ a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”\\n\\n“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\\ntone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing\\nseems to suit them!”\\n\\n“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.\\n\\n“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried\\nhedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those\\nserpents! There’s no pleasing them!”\\n\\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\\n\\n“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon;\\n“but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I\\nhaven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”\\n\\n“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to\\nsee its meaning.\\n\\n“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the\\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I\\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\\nfrom the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”\\n\\n“But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”\\n\\n“Well! _What_ are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to\\ninvent something!”\\n\\n“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day.\\n\\n“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\\ncontempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\\n_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s\\nno use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never\\ntasted an egg!”\\n\\n“I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful\\nchild; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\\nknow.”\\n\\n“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then\\nthey’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”\\n\\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re\\nlooking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\\nme whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”\\n\\n“It matters a good deal to _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not\\nlooking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want\\n_yours_: I don’t like them raw.”\\n\\n“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\\nshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\\nand she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\\nthe other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\\nshe had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\\n\\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\\nand began talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan\\ndone now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m\\ngoing to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my\\nright size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how\\n_is_ that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly\\nupon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\\n“Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them\\n_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she\\nbegan nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go\\nnear the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\nPig and Pepper\\n\\n\\nFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\\nwood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\\nfish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by\\nanother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\\nall over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\\n\\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\\nsaying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the\\nQueen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen.\\nAn invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”\\n\\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\\n\\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\\nfor fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\\ndoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.\\n\\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\\n\\n“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for\\ntwo reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you\\nare; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could\\npossibly hear you.” And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\\nnoise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now\\nand then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\\npieces.\\n\\n“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”\\n\\n“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on\\nwithout attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance,\\nif you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\\nknow.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\\nthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,”\\nshe said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\\nhead. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?”\\nshe repeated, aloud.\\n\\n“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”\\n\\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\\nskimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,\\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\\n\\n“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\\nas if nothing had happened.\\n\\n“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\\n\\n“_Are_ you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first\\nquestion, you know.”\\n\\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really\\ndreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue.\\nIt’s enough to drive one crazy!”\\n\\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\\nremark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for\\ndays and days.”\\n\\n“But what am _I_ to do?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.\\n\\n“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s\\nperfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.\\n\\nThe door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\\none end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\\nin the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,\\nstirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\\n\\n“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to\\nherself, as well as she could for sneezing.\\n\\nThere was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed\\noccasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\\nalternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen\\nthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\\non the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\\n\\n“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why\\nyour cat grins like that?”\\n\\n“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”\\n\\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\\njumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\\nbaby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—\\n\\n“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t\\nknow that cats _could_ grin.”\\n\\n“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”\\n\\n“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite\\npleased to have got into a conversation.\\n\\n“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”\\n\\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\\nbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\\nwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\\nfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\\nthe Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a\\nshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\\n\\n“Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down\\nin an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an\\nunusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\\noff.\\n\\n“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse\\ngrowl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”\\n\\n“Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to\\nget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just\\nthink of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\\nearth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”\\n\\n“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”\\n\\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\\nthe hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\\nbe listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or\\nis it twelve? I—”\\n\\n“Oh, don’t bother _me_,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide\\nfigures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\\nsort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\\nthe end of every line:\\n\\n“Speak roughly to your little boy,\\n    And beat him when he sneezes:\\nHe only does it to annoy,\\n    Because he knows it teases.”\\n\\n\\nCHORUS.\\n(In which the cook and the baby joined):\\n\\n\\n“Wow! wow! wow!”\\n\\n\\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words:—\\n\\n“I speak severely to my boy,\\n    I beat him when he sneezes;\\nFor he can thoroughly enjoy\\n    The pepper when he pleases!”\\n\\n\\nCHORUS.\\n\\n\\n“Wow! wow! wow!”\\n\\n\\n“Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice,\\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready to play\\ncroquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. The cook\\nthrew a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\\n\\nAlice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\\nlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\\n“just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was\\nsnorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\\nitself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\\nthe first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\\n\\nAs soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it\\nout into the open air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,”\\nthought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be\\nmurder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the\\nlittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\\n“Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of\\nexpressing yourself.”\\n\\nThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\\nto see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\\na _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\\nits eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\\nnot like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was only\\nsobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\\nwere any tears.\\n\\nNo, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,”\\nsaid Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\\nnow!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\\nto say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\\n\\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do\\nwith this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so\\nviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time\\nthere could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\\na pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\\nfurther.\\n\\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\\ntrot away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to\\nherself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\\nrather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other\\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\\nto herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she\\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\\na tree a few yards off.\\n\\nThe Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\\nthought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she\\nfelt that it ought to be treated with respect.\\n\\n“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\\nwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little\\nwider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on.\\n“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”\\n\\n“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.\\n\\n“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.\\n\\n“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.\\n\\n“—so long as I get _somewhere_,” Alice added as an explanation.\\n\\n“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long\\nenough.”\\n\\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\\nquestion. “What sort of people live about here?”\\n\\n“In _that_ direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives\\na Hatter: and in _that_ direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a\\nMarch Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”\\n\\n“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.\\n\\n“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad.\\nYou’re mad.”\\n\\n“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.\\n\\n“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”\\n\\nAlice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how\\ndo you know that you’re mad?”\\n\\n“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?”\\n\\n“I suppose so,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry,\\nand wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now _I_ growl when I’m pleased,\\nand wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”\\n\\n“_I_ call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the\\nQueen to-day?”\\n\\n“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited\\nyet.”\\n\\n“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.\\n\\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\\nthings happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\\nit suddenly appeared again.\\n\\n“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly\\nforgotten to ask.”\\n\\n“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\\nin a natural way.\\n\\n“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.\\n\\nAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\\nwhich the March Hare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she\\nsaid to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\\nperhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it\\nwas in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\\nagain, sitting on a branch of a tree.\\n\\n“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.\\n\\n“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing\\nand vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”\\n\\n“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone.\\n\\n“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a\\ngrin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”\\n\\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\\nthe March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\\nnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\\nto about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather\\ntimidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all!\\nI almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\nA Mad Tea-Party\\n\\n\\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very\\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep,\\nI suppose it doesn’t mind.”\\n\\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\\none corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw\\nAlice coming. “There’s _plenty_ of room!” said Alice indignantly, and\\nshe sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\\n\\n“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\\n\\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\\n“I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.\\n\\n“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.\\n\\n“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.\\n\\n“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said\\nthe March Hare.\\n\\n“I didn’t know it was _your_ table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great\\nmany more than three.”\\n\\n“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at\\nAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\\nspeech.\\n\\n“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some\\nseverity; “it’s very rude.”\\n\\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\\nwas, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”\\n\\n“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve\\nbegun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.\\n\\n“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said\\nthe March Hare.\\n\\n“Exactly so,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.\\n\\n“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I\\nsay—that’s the same thing, you know.”\\n\\n“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “You might just as well\\nsay that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”\\n\\n“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what\\nI get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”\\n\\n“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\\ntalking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing\\nas ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”\\n\\n“It _is_ the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the\\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\\nAlice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\\nwriting-desks, which wasn’t much.\\n\\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month\\nis it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\\nand holding it to his ear.\\n\\nAlice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”\\n\\n“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn’t suit\\nthe works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\\n\\n“It was the _best_ butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.\\n\\n“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled:\\n“you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”\\n\\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\\nnothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the _best_ butter,\\nyou know.”\\n\\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What a\\nfunny watch!” she remarked. “It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t\\ntell what o’clock it is!”\\n\\n“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter. “Does _your_ watch tell you what\\nyear it is?”\\n\\n“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it\\nstays the same year for such a long time together.”\\n\\n“Which is just the case with _mine_,” said the Hatter.\\n\\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no\\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quite\\nunderstand you,” she said, as politely as she could.\\n\\n“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little\\nhot tea upon its nose.\\n\\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\\neyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”\\n\\n“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice\\nagain.\\n\\n“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”\\n\\n“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.\\n\\n“Nor I,” said the March Hare.\\n\\nAlice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the\\ntime,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no\\nanswers.”\\n\\n“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk\\nabout wasting _it_. It’s _him_.”\\n\\n“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head\\ncontemptuously. “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”\\n\\n“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat\\ntime when I learn music.”\\n\\n“Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter. “He won’t stand beating.\\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything\\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in\\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a\\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\\ntime for dinner!”\\n\\n(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\\n\\n“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I\\nshouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”\\n\\n“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to\\nhalf-past one as long as you liked.”\\n\\n“Is that the way _you_ manage?” Alice asked.\\n\\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied. “We\\nquarrelled last March—just before _he_ went mad, you know—” (pointing\\nwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert\\ngiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\\n\\n‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\\nHow I wonder what you’re at!’\\n\\n\\nYou know the song, perhaps?”\\n\\n“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.\\n\\n“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—\\n\\n‘Up above the world you fly,\\nLike a tea-tray in the sky.\\n                    Twinkle, twinkle—’”\\n\\n\\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\\n“_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—” and went on so long that they\\nhad to pinch it to make it stop.\\n\\n“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when the\\nQueen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time! Off with his\\nhead!’”\\n\\n“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.\\n\\n“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t\\ndo a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.”\\n\\nA bright idea came into Alice’s head. “Is that the reason so many\\ntea-things are put out here?” she asked.\\n\\n“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time,\\nand we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”\\n\\n“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”\\n\\n“But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Alice ventured\\nto ask.\\n\\n“Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\\n“I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.”\\n\\n“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the\\nproposal.\\n\\n“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up, Dormouse!” And\\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.\\n\\nThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “I wasn’t asleep,” he said in a\\nhoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.”\\n\\n“Tell us a story!” said the March Hare.\\n\\n“Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.\\n\\n“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter, “or you’ll be asleep again\\nbefore it’s done.”\\n\\n“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began\\nin a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\\nthey lived at the bottom of a well—”\\n\\n“What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great interest\\nin questions of eating and drinking.\\n\\n“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\\ntwo.\\n\\n“They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gently remarked;\\n“they’d have been ill.”\\n\\n“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “_very_ ill.”\\n\\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\\nliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: “But\\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?”\\n\\n“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\\n\\n“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t\\ntake more.”\\n\\n“You mean you can’t take _less_,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to\\ntake _more_ than nothing.”\\n\\n“Nobody asked _your_ opinion,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Who’s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter asked triumphantly.\\n\\nAlice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\\nsome tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\\nrepeated her question. “Why did they live at the bottom of a well?”\\n\\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\\nsaid, “It was a treacle-well.”\\n\\n“There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\\nHatter and the March Hare went “Sh! sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily\\nremarked, “If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for\\nyourself.”\\n\\n“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’t interrupt again. I\\ndare say there may be _one_.”\\n\\n“One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\\ngo on. “And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw,\\nyou know—”\\n\\n“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\\n\\n“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\\n\\n“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place\\non.”\\n\\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\\nmoved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\\nplace of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\\n\\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\\ncautiously: “But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle\\nfrom?”\\n\\n“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I should\\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”\\n\\n“But they were _in_ the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\\nto notice this last remark.\\n\\n“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.”\\n\\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\\nsome time without interrupting it.\\n\\n“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all manner of\\nthings—everything that begins with an M—”\\n\\n“Why with an M?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Why not?” said the March Hare.\\n\\nAlice was silent.\\n\\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\\nlittle shriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as\\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say\\nthings are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a\\ndrawing of a muchness?”\\n\\n“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t\\nthink—”\\n\\n“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.\\n\\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\\nthe teapot.\\n\\n“At any rate I’ll never go _there_ again!” said Alice as she picked her\\nway through the wood. “It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in\\nall my life!”\\n\\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\\nleading right into it. “That’s very curious!” she thought. “But\\neverything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.” And\\nin she went.\\n\\nOnce more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\\nglass table. “Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself,\\nand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\\nled into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom\\n(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot\\nhigh: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_—she found\\nherself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds\\nand the cool fountains.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\nThe Queen’s Croquet-Ground\\n\\n\\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\\nwent nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\\none of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me\\nlike that!”\\n\\n“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my\\nelbow.”\\n\\nOn which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the\\nblame on others!”\\n\\n“_You’d_ better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only\\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”\\n\\n“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.\\n\\n“That’s none of _your_ business, Two!” said Seven.\\n\\n“Yes, it _is_ his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for\\nbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”\\n\\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust\\nthings—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\\nthem, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,\\nand all of them bowed low.\\n\\n“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are\\npainting those roses?”\\n\\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\\nvoice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\\n_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So\\nyou see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this\\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\\nout “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw\\nthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\\n\\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\\nthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\\nornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\\nand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\\nby without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\\nthe King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\\n\\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\\nof such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a\\nprocession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their\\nfaces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was,\\nand waited.\\n\\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\\nat her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the\\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\\n\\n“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\\nAlice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”\\n\\n“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely;\\nbut she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after\\nall. I needn’t be afraid of them!”\\n\\n“And who are _these?_” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\\nwho were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on\\ntheir faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\\nthe pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\\nor courtiers, or three of her own children.\\n\\n“How should _I_ know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s\\nno business of _mine_.”\\n\\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\\nmoment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”\\n\\n“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\\nsilent.\\n\\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my\\ndear: she is only a child!”\\n\\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn\\nthem over!”\\n\\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\\n\\n“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\\nthe royal children, and everybody else.\\n\\n“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then,\\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What _have_ you been doing\\nhere?”\\n\\n“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going\\ndown on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”\\n\\n“_I_ see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\\n“Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the\\nsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\\nto Alice for protection.\\n\\n“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large\\nflower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\\nminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\\nothers.\\n\\n“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.\\n\\n“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted\\nin reply.\\n\\n“That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”\\n\\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\\nevidently meant for her.\\n\\n“Yes!” shouted Alice.\\n\\n“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\\nwondering very much what would happen next.\\n\\n“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was\\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\\n\\n“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”\\n\\n“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\\ntiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under\\nsentence of execution.”\\n\\n“What for?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.\\n\\n“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said\\n‘What for?’”\\n\\n“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\\nscream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\\ntone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\\nQueen said—”\\n\\n“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\\nother; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\\nbegan. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\\nin her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\\nhedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\\nthemselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\\n\\nThe chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\\nunder her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\\nhad got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\\nhedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\\nup in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\\nbursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\\ngoing to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\\nhad unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\\nthis, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\\nwanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\\nalways getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\\nsoon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\\n\\nThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\\nthe Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\\nshouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a\\nminute.\\n\\nAlice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\\n“and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully\\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any\\none left alive!”\\n\\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\\nappearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\\nwatching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\\nto herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\\nto.”\\n\\n“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\\nenough for it to speak with.\\n\\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use\\nspeaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one\\nof them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\\nshe had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there\\nwas enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\\n\\n“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a\\ncomplaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear\\noneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at\\nleast, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how\\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the\\narch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\\nground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only\\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!”\\n\\n“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.\\n\\n“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed\\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\\n“—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”\\n\\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.\\n\\n“Who _are_ you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and\\nlooking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.\\n\\n“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to\\nintroduce it.”\\n\\n“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may\\nkiss my hand if it likes.”\\n\\n“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.\\n\\n“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like\\nthat!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.\\n\\n“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book,\\nbut I don’t remember where.”\\n\\n“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called\\nthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish you would\\nhave this cat removed!”\\n\\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\\nsmall. “Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.\\n\\n“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he\\nhurried off.\\n\\nAlice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\\non, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with\\npassion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\\nwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\\n\\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\\nthe other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\\nhelpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\\n\\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t\\nmatter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side\\nof the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\\nfriend.\\n\\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\\na large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\\nwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\\n\\nThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\\nall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\\nwhat they said.\\n\\nThe executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless\\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\\nthing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at _his_ time of life.\\n\\nThe King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\\nbeheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.\\n\\nThe Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in\\nless than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was\\nthis last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and\\nanxious.)\\n\\nAlice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the\\nDuchess: you’d better ask _her_ about it.”\\n\\n“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.”\\nAnd the executioner went off like an arrow.\\n\\nThe Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\\ntime he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so\\nthe King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,\\nwhile the rest of the party went back to the game.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\nThe Mock Turtle’s Story\\n\\n\\n“You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!”\\nsaid the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s,\\nand they walked off together.\\n\\nAlice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\\nsavage when they met in the kitchen.\\n\\n“When _I’m_ a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful\\ntone though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup\\ndoes very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people\\nhot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\\nkind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes\\nthem bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children\\nsweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn’t be\\nso stingy about it, you know—”\\n\\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking\\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t\\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\\na bit.”\\n\\n“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.\\n\\n“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only\\nyou can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as\\nshe spoke.\\n\\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\\nDuchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\\nright height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an\\nuncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\\nbore it as well as she could.\\n\\n“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up\\nthe conversation a little.\\n\\n“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love,\\n’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”\\n\\n“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding\\ntheir own business!”\\n\\n“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her\\nsharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of\\n_that_ is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\\nthemselves.’”\\n\\n“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to\\nherself.\\n\\n“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,”\\nthe Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about\\nthe temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”\\n\\n“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious\\nto have the experiment tried.\\n\\n“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\\nthe moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”\\n\\n“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.\\n\\n“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of\\nputting things!”\\n\\n“It’s a mineral, I _think_,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\\neverything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here.\\nAnd the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is\\nof yours.’”\\n\\n“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last\\nremark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”\\n\\n“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that\\nis—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more\\nsimply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not\\notherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\\notherwise.’”\\n\\n“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely,\\n“if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”\\n\\n“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied,\\nin a pleased tone.\\n\\n“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said\\nAlice.\\n\\n“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “I make you a present\\nof everything I’ve said as yet.”\\n\\n“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they don’t give\\nbirthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out\\nloud.\\n\\n“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\\nlittle chin.\\n\\n“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\\nfeel a little worried.\\n\\n“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and\\nthe m—”\\n\\nBut here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away,\\neven in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was\\nlinked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the\\nQueen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a\\nthunderstorm.\\n\\n“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\\n\\n“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the\\nground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in\\nabout half no time! Take your choice!”\\n\\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\\n\\n“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too\\nmuch frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\\ncroquet-ground.\\n\\nThe other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were\\nresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\\nback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay\\nwould cost them their lives.\\n\\nAll the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling\\nwith the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with\\nher head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the\\nsoldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so\\nthat by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and\\nall the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody\\nand under sentence of execution.\\n\\nThen the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, “Have\\nyou seen the Mock Turtle yet?”\\n\\n“No,” said Alice. “I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”\\n\\n“It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said the Queen.\\n\\n“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history,”\\n\\nAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\\nto the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, _that’s_ a\\ngood thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\\nnumber of executions the Queen had ordered.\\n\\nThey very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If\\nyou don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy\\nthing!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock\\nTurtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\\nexecutions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone\\nwith the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,\\nbut on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it\\nas to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.\\n\\nThe Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\\nshe was out of sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said the Gryphon,\\nhalf to itself, half to Alice.\\n\\n“What _is_ the fun?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Why, _she_,” said the Gryphon. “It’s all her fancy, that: they never\\nexecutes nobody, you know. Come on!”\\n\\n“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly\\nafter it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”\\n\\nThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\\nnearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\\npitied him deeply. “What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the\\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all\\nhis fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!”\\n\\nSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\\nfull of tears, but said nothing.\\n\\n“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your\\nhistory, she do.”\\n\\n“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit\\ndown, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”\\n\\nSo they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\\nherself, “I don’t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn’t begin.”\\nBut she waited patiently.\\n\\n“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real\\nTurtle.”\\n\\nThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\\noccasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant\\nheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\\nsaying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not\\nhelp thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said\\nnothing.\\n\\n“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\\nthough still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the\\nsea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”\\n\\n“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.\\n\\n“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle\\nangrily: “really you are very dull!”\\n\\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\\nquestion,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked\\nat poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the\\nGryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all\\nday about it!” and he went on in these words:\\n\\n“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”\\n\\n“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.\\n\\n“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\\nThe Mock Turtle went on.\\n\\n“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”\\n\\n“_I’ve_ been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so\\nproud as all that.”\\n\\n“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”\\n\\n“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.\\n\\n“Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a\\ntone of great relief. “Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,\\n‘French, music, _and washing_—extra.’”\\n\\n“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom\\nof the sea.”\\n\\n“I couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. “I\\nonly took the regular course.”\\n\\n“What was that?” inquired Alice.\\n\\n“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle\\nreplied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,\\nDistraction, Uglification, and Derision.”\\n\\n“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say. “What is it?”\\n\\nThe Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “What! Never heard of\\nuglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”\\n\\n“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify\\nis, you _are_ a simpleton.”\\n\\nAlice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so\\nshe turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”\\n\\n“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the\\nsubjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with\\nSeaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\\nthat used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\\nFainting in Coils.”\\n\\n“What was _that_ like?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too\\nstiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.”\\n\\n“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master,\\nthough. He was an old crab, _he_ was.”\\n\\n“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught\\nLaughing and Grief, they used to say.”\\n\\n“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\\ncreatures hid their faces in their paws.\\n\\n“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry\\nto change the subject.\\n\\n“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so\\non.”\\n\\n“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.\\n\\n“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked:\\n“because they lessen from day to day.”\\n\\nThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\\nbefore she made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been\\na holiday?”\\n\\n“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.\\n\\n“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very\\ndecided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\nThe Lobster Quadrille\\n\\n\\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\\nhis eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\\ntwo sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,”\\nsaid the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\\nthe back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\\nrunning down his cheeks, he went on again:—\\n\\n“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said\\nAlice)—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—”\\n(Alice began to say “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and\\nsaid “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\\nLobster Quadrille is!”\\n\\n“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”\\n\\n“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the\\nsea-shore—”\\n\\n“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\\nthen, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”\\n\\n“_That_ generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.\\n\\n“—you advance twice—”\\n\\n“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.\\n\\n“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”\\n\\n“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.\\n\\n“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”\\n\\n“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\\n\\n“—as far out to sea as you can—”\\n\\n“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.\\n\\n“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\\nabout.\\n\\n“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\\n\\n“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock\\nTurtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had\\nbeen jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very\\nsadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\\n\\n“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.\\n\\n“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“Very much indeed,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the\\nGryphon. “We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”\\n\\n“Oh, _you_ sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’ve forgotten the words.”\\n\\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\\nthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\\nforepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\\nand sadly:—\\n\\n“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.\\n“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.\\nSee how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\\nThey are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?\\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?\\n\\n“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\\nWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”\\nBut the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—\\nSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\\n\\n“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.\\n“There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\\nThe further off from England the nearer is to France—\\nThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”\\n\\n\\n“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice,\\nfeeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that\\ncurious song about the whiting!”\\n\\n“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen them,\\nof course?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked herself\\nhastily.\\n\\n“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve\\nseen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”\\n\\n“I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails in\\ntheir mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”\\n\\n“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would\\nall wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;\\nand the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his\\neyes.—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.\\n\\n“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they _would_ go with the\\nlobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to\\nfall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they\\ncouldn’t get them out again. That’s all.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much\\nabout a whiting before.”\\n\\n“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do you\\nknow why it’s called a whiting?”\\n\\n“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”\\n\\n“_It does the boots and shoes_,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\\n\\nAlice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated\\nin a wondering tone.\\n\\n“Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean, what\\nmakes them so shiny?”\\n\\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\\nanswer. “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”\\n\\n“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\\n“are done with a whiting. Now you know.”\\n\\n“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\\n\\n“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\\n“any shrimp could have told you that.”\\n\\n“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still\\nrunning on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back,\\nplease: we don’t want _you_ with us!’”\\n\\n“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no\\nwise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”\\n\\n“Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\\n\\n“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to _me_,\\nand told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’”\\n\\n“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.\\n\\n“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\\nthe Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of _your_ adventures.”\\n\\n“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said\\nAlice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday,\\nbecause I was a different person then.”\\n\\n“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\\n“explanations take such a dreadful time.”\\n\\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\\nsaw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\\nthe two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\\ntheir eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she\\nwent on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\\nabout her repeating “_You are old, Father William_,” to the\\nCaterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\\nTurtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”\\n\\n“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.\\n\\n“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I\\nshould like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to\\nbegin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\\nauthority over Alice.\\n\\n“Stand up and repeat ‘’_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,’” said the\\nGryphon.\\n\\n“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!”\\nthought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got\\nup, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\\nQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\\nvery queer indeed:—\\n\\n“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\\n“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”\\nAs a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\\nTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”\\n\\n[later editions continued as follows\\nWhen the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\\nAnd will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\\nBut, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\\nHis voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\\n\\n\\n“That’s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,” said\\nthe Gryphon.\\n\\n“Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle; “but it sounds\\nuncommon nonsense.”\\n\\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\\nwondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.\\n\\n“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily. “Go on with the next\\nverse.”\\n\\n“But about his toes?” the Mock Turtle persisted. “How _could_ he turn\\nthem out with his nose, you know?”\\n\\n“It’s the first position in dancing.” Alice said; but was dreadfully\\npuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\\n\\n“Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it\\nbegins ‘_I passed by his garden_.’”\\n\\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\\nwrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—\\n\\n“I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\\nHow the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—”\\n\\n[later editions continued as follows\\nThe Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\\nWhile the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\\nWhen the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\\nWas kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\\nWhile the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\\nAnd concluded the banquet—]\\n\\n\\n“What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,” the Mock Turtle\\ninterrupted, “if you don’t explain it as you go on? It’s by far the\\nmost confusing thing _I_ ever heard!”\\n\\n“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: and Alice was\\nonly too glad to do so.\\n\\n“Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?” the Gryphon\\nwent on. “Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?”\\n\\n“Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,” Alice\\nreplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,\\n“Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her ‘_Turtle Soup_,’ will you, old\\nfellow?”\\n\\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked\\nwith sobs, to sing this:—\\n\\n“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\\nWaiting in a hot tureen!\\nWho for such dainties would not stoop?\\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\nSoo—oop of the e—e—evening,\\n    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\\n\\n“Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,\\nGame, or any other dish?\\nWho would not give all else for two p\\nennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\\nPennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\nSoo—oop of the e—e—evening,\\n    Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!”\\n\\n\\n“Chorus again!” cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun\\nto repeat it, when a cry of “The trial’s beginning!” was heard in the\\ndistance.\\n\\n“Come on!” cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried\\noff, without waiting for the end of the song.\\n\\n“What trial is it?” Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only\\nanswered “Come on!” and ran the faster, while more and more faintly\\ncame, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:—\\n\\n“Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,\\n    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\nWho Stole the Tarts?\\n\\n\\nThe King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\\narrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little\\nbirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\\nstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\\nhim; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one\\nhand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the\\ncourt was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so\\ngood, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d\\nget the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments!”\\nBut there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at\\neverything about her, to pass away the time.\\n\\nAlice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\\nabout them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\\nthe name of nearly everything there. “That’s the judge,” she said to\\nherself, “because of his great wig.”\\n\\nThe judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\\nwig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he\\ndid not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\\n\\n“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,”\\n(she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were\\nanimals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She\\nsaid this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather\\nproud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little\\ngirls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, “jury-men”\\nwould have done just as well.\\n\\nThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are\\nthey doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything\\nto put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”\\n\\n“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply,\\n“for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”\\n\\n“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she\\nstopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the\\ncourt!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,\\nto make out who was talking.\\n\\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\\nthat all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates,\\nand she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell\\n“stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice\\nmuddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.\\n\\nOne of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\\ncould _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\\nvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\\nthat the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\\nat all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he\\nwas obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this\\nwas of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\\n\\n“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.\\n\\nOn this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\\nunrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—\\n\\n“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\\n    All on a summer day:\\nThe Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\\n    And took them quite away!”\\n\\n\\n“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.\\n\\n“Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’s a great\\ndeal to come before that!”\\n\\n“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew\\nthree blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”\\n\\nThe first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand\\nand a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon, your\\nMajesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished\\nmy tea when I was sent for.”\\n\\n“You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you begin?”\\n\\nThe Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\\ncourt, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it\\nwas,” he said.\\n\\n“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.\\n\\n“Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.\\n\\n“Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\\nwrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\\nreduced the answer to shillings and pence.\\n\\n“Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.\\n\\n“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.\\n\\n“_Stolen!_” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made\\na memorandum of the fact.\\n\\n“I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none\\nof my own. I’m a hatter.”\\n\\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\\nwho turned pale and fidgeted.\\n\\n“Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll\\nhave you executed on the spot.”\\n\\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\\nfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his\\nconfusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\\nbread-and-butter.\\n\\nJust at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\\nas long as there was room for her.\\n\\n“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.” said the Dormouse, who was sitting\\nnext to her. “I can hardly breathe.”\\n\\n“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”\\n\\n“You’ve no right to grow _here_,” said the Dormouse.\\n\\n“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re growing\\ntoo.”\\n\\n“Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in\\nthat ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over\\nto the other side of the court.\\n\\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\\nof the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!”\\non which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes\\noff.\\n\\n“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you\\nexecuted, whether you’re nervous or not.”\\n\\n“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\\n“—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the\\nbread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—”\\n\\n“The twinkling of the _what?_” said the King.\\n\\n“It _began_ with the tea,” the Hatter replied.\\n\\n“Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply. “Do you\\ntake me for a dunce? Go on!”\\n\\n“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after\\nthat—only the March Hare said—”\\n\\n“I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\\n\\n“You did!” said the Hatter.\\n\\n“I deny it!” said the March Hare.\\n\\n“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”\\n\\n“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking\\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\\nnothing, being fast asleep.\\n\\n“After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”\\n\\n“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.\\n\\n“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.\\n\\n“You _must_ remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”\\n\\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\\ndown on one knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.\\n\\n“You’re a _very_ poor _speaker_,” said the King.\\n\\nHere one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\\nthe officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\\nexplain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\\nup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\\nhead first, and then sat upon it.)\\n\\n“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice. “I’ve so often read in\\nthe newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at\\napplause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\\ncourt,” and I never understood what it meant till now.”\\n\\n“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the\\nKing.\\n\\n“I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor, as it is.”\\n\\n“Then you may _sit_ down,” the King replied.\\n\\nHere the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\\n\\n“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now we shall get\\non better.”\\n\\n“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxious look at\\nthe Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\\n\\n“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\\nwithout even waiting to put his shoes on.\\n\\n“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the\\nofficers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\\nto the door.\\n\\n“Call the next witness!” said the King.\\n\\nThe next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box in\\nher hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\\ncourt, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.\\n\\n“Give your evidence,” said the King.\\n\\n“Shan’t,” said the cook.\\n\\nThe King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\\n“Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.”\\n\\n“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air, and,\\nafter folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\\nnearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?”\\n\\n“Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.\\n\\n“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.\\n\\n“Collar that Dormouse,” the Queen shrieked out. “Behead that Dormouse!\\nTurn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his\\nwhiskers!”\\n\\nFor some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse\\nturned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had\\ndisappeared.\\n\\n“Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief. “Call the\\nnext witness.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Really, my\\ndear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my\\nforehead ache!”\\n\\nAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling\\nvery curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they\\nhaven’t got much evidence _yet_,” she said to herself. Imagine her\\nsurprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill\\nlittle voice, the name “Alice!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\nAlice’s Evidence\\n\\n\\n“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\\nlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\\na hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\\nupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\\nthey lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of\\ngoldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.\\n\\n“Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\\nbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident\\nof the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of\\nidea that they must be collected at once and put back into the\\njury-box, or they would die.\\n\\n“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice, “until\\nall the jurymen are back in their proper places—_all_,” he repeated\\nwith great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.\\n\\nAlice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\\nthe Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\\ntail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon\\ngot it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she\\nsaid to herself; “I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the\\ntrial one way up as the other.”\\n\\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\\ncourt.\\n\\n“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.\\n\\n“Nothing,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Nothing _whatever?_” persisted the King.\\n\\n“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.\\n\\n“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury. They were\\njust beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White\\nRabbit interrupted: “_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,” he\\nsaid in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as\\nhe spoke.\\n\\n“_Un_important, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on\\nto himself in an undertone,\\n\\n“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he were trying\\nwhich word sounded best.\\n\\nSome of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.”\\nAlice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\\n“but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.\\n\\nAt this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\\nhis note-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from his book, “Rule\\nForty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.”\\n\\nEverybody looked at Alice.\\n\\n“_I’m_ not a mile high,” said Alice.\\n\\n“You are,” said the King.\\n\\n“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.\\n\\n“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a\\nregular rule: you invented it just now.”\\n\\n“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.\\n\\n“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.\\n\\nThe King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. “Consider your\\nverdict,” he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\\n\\n“There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,” said the\\nWhite Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just been\\npicked up.”\\n\\n“What’s in it?” said the Queen.\\n\\n“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a\\nletter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.”\\n\\n“It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to\\nnobody, which isn’t usual, you know.”\\n\\n“Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.\\n\\n“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’s\\nnothing written on the _outside_.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke,\\nand added “It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.”\\n\\n“Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.\\n\\n“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest\\nthing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)\\n\\n“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King. (The jury\\nall brightened up again.)\\n\\n“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they\\ncan’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.”\\n\\n“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter\\nworse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed\\nyour name like an honest man.”\\n\\nThere was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\\nclever thing the King had said that day.\\n\\n“That _proves_ his guilt,” said the Queen.\\n\\n“It proves nothing of the sort!” said Alice. “Why, you don’t even know\\nwhat they’re about!”\\n\\n“Read them,” said the King.\\n\\nThe White Rabbit put on his spectacles. “Where shall I begin, please\\nyour Majesty?” he asked.\\n\\n“Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely, “and go on till you\\ncome to the end: then stop.”\\n\\nThese were the verses the White Rabbit read:—\\n\\n“They told me you had been to her,\\n    And mentioned me to him:\\nShe gave me a good character,\\n    But said I could not swim.\\n\\nHe sent them word I had not gone\\n    (We know it to be true):\\nIf she should push the matter on,\\n    What would become of you?\\n\\nI gave her one, they gave him two,\\n    You gave us three or more;\\nThey all returned from him to you,\\n    Though they were mine before.\\n\\nIf I or she should chance to be\\n    Involved in this affair,\\nHe trusts to you to set them free,\\n    Exactly as we were.\\n\\nMy notion was that you had been\\n    (Before she had this fit)\\nAn obstacle that came between\\n    Him, and ourselves, and it.\\n\\nDon’t let him know she liked them best,\\n    For this must ever be\\nA secret, kept from all the rest,\\n    Between yourself and me.”\\n\\n\\n“That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said the\\nKing, rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”\\n\\n“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown so\\nlarge in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of\\ninterrupting him,) “I’ll give him sixpence. _I_ don’t believe there’s\\nan atom of meaning in it.”\\n\\nThe jury all wrote down on their slates, “_She_ doesn’t believe there’s\\nan atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the\\npaper.\\n\\n“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of\\ntrouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t\\nknow,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at\\nthem with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.\\n“—_said I could not swim_—” you can’t swim, can you?” he added, turning\\nto the Knave.\\n\\nThe Knave shook his head sadly. “Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he\\ncertainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)\\n\\n“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the\\nverses to himself: “‘_We know it to be true_—’ that’s the jury, of\\ncourse—‘_I gave her one, they gave him two_—’ why, that must be what he\\ndid with the tarts, you know—”\\n\\n“But, it goes on ‘_they all returned from him to you_,’” said Alice.\\n\\n“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the\\ntarts on the table. “Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then\\nagain—‘_before she had this fit_—’ you never had fits, my dear, I\\nthink?” he said to the Queen.\\n\\n“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\\nas she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\\nas it lasted.)\\n\\n“Then the words don’t _fit_ you,” said the King, looking round the\\ncourt with a smile. There was a dead silence.\\n\\n“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody\\nlaughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for\\nabout the twentieth time that day.\\n\\n“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”\\n\\n“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the\\nsentence first!”\\n\\n“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.\\n\\n“I won’t!” said Alice.\\n\\n“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\\nmoved.\\n\\n“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by\\nthis time.) “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”\\n\\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\\nher: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\\n\\n“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve\\nhad!”\\n\\n“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her\\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\\nAdventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she\\nhad finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It _was_ a curious\\ndream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”\\nSo Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\\nwhat a wonderful dream it had been.\\n\\n\\nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\\nhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\\nher wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\\nand this was her dream:—\\n\\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\\nlooking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and\\nsee that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\\nthat _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or\\nseemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\\nstrange creatures of her little sister’s dream.\\n\\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the\\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she\\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby\\nwas sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\\naround it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\\nLizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\\nTurtle.\\n\\nSo she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\\nwould change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the\\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling\\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill\\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the\\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\\n(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the\\nlowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\\nTurtle’s heavy sobs.\\n\\nLastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,\\nand make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\\nperhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she\\nwould feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\\ntheir simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer\\ndays.\\n'"

I keep science for Life.\\n\\nLANE.\\nYes, sir.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nAnd, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber\\nsandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?\\n\\nLANE.\\nYes, sir. [Hands them on a salver.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.] Oh! . . . by the\\nway, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord\\nShoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of\\nchampagne are entered as having been consumed.\\n\\nLANE.\\nYes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWhy is it that at a bachelor’s establishment the servants invariably\\ndrink the champagne? I ask merely for information.\\n\\nLANE.\\nI attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir. I have often\\nobserved that in married households the champagne is rarely of a\\nfirst-rate brand.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nGood heavens! Is marriage so demoralising as that?\\n\\nLANE.\\nI believe it _is_ a very pleasant state, sir. I have had very little\\nexperience of it myself up to the present. I have only been married\\nonce. That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and\\na young person.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Languidly_._] I don’t know that I am much interested in your family\\nlife, Lane.\\n\\nLANE.\\nNo, sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it\\nmyself.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nVery natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, thank you.\\n\\nLANE.\\nThank you, sir. [Lane goes out.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nLane’s views on marriage seem somewhat lax. Really, if the lower orders\\ndon’t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They\\nseem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.\\n\\n[Enter Lane.]\\n\\nLANE.\\nMr. Ernest Worthing.\\n\\n[Enter Jack.]\\n\\n[Lane goes out_._]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nHow are you, my dear Ernest? What brings you up to town?\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, pleasure, pleasure! What else should bring one anywhere? Eating as\\nusual, I see, Algy!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Stiffly_._] I believe it is customary in good society to take some\\nslight refreshment at five o’clock. Where have you been since last\\nThursday?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Sitting down on the sofa.] In the country.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWhat on earth do you do there?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Pulling off his gloves_._] When one is in town one amuses oneself.\\nWhen one is in the country one amuses other people. It is excessively\\nboring.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nAnd who are the people you amuse?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Airily_._] Oh, neighbours, neighbours.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nGot nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?\\n\\nJACK.\\nPerfectly horrid! Never speak to one of them.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nHow immensely you must amuse them! [Goes over and takes sandwich.] By\\nthe way, Shropshire is your county, is it not?\\n\\nJACK.\\nEh? Shropshire? Yes, of course. Hallo! Why all these cups? Why cucumber\\nsandwiches? Why such reckless extravagance in one so young? Who is\\ncoming to tea?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOh! merely Aunt Augusta and Gwendolen.\\n\\nJACK.\\nHow perfectly delightful!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won’t quite\\napprove of your being here.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMay I ask why?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nMy dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly\\ndisgraceful. It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI am in love with Gwendolen. I have come up to town expressly to\\npropose to her.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI thought you had come up for pleasure? . . . I call that business.\\n\\nJACK.\\nHow utterly unromantic you are!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI really don’t see anything romantic in proposing. It is very romantic\\nto be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal.\\nWhy, one may be accepted. One usually is, I believe. Then the\\nexcitement is all over. The very essence of romance is uncertainty. If\\never I get married, I’ll certainly try to forget the fact.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI have no doubt about that, dear Algy. The Divorce Court was specially\\ninvented for people whose memories are so curiously constituted.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOh! there is no use speculating on that subject. Divorces are made in\\nHeaven—[Jack puts out his hand to take a sandwich. Algernon at once\\ninterferes.] Please don’t touch the cucumber sandwiches. They are\\nordered specially for Aunt Augusta. [Takes one and eats it.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, you have been eating them all the time.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThat is quite a different matter. She is my aunt. [Takes plate from\\nbelow.] Have some bread and butter. The bread and butter is for\\nGwendolen. Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Advancing to table and helping himself.] And very good bread and\\nbutter it is too.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to eat it\\nall. You behave as if you were married to her already. You are not\\nmarried to her already, and I don’t think you ever will be.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWhy on earth do you say that?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with.\\nGirls don’t think it right.\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, that is nonsense!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIt isn’t. It is a great truth. It accounts for the extraordinary number\\nof bachelors that one sees all over the place. In the second place, I\\ndon’t give my consent.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYour consent!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nMy dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin. And before I allow you to\\nmarry her, you will have to clear up the whole question of Cecily.\\n[Rings bell.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nCecily! What on earth do you mean? What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily! I\\ndon’t know any one of the name of Cecily.\\n\\n[Enter Lane.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing left in the smoking-room the\\nlast time he dined here.\\n\\nLANE.\\nYes, sir. [Lane goes out.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nDo you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time? I wish\\nto goodness you had let me know. I have been writing frantic letters to\\nScotland Yard about it. I was very nearly offering a large reward.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, I wish you would offer one. I happen to be more than usually hard\\nup.\\n\\nJACK.\\nThere is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is found.\\n\\n[Enter Lane with the cigarette case on a salver. Algernon takes it at\\nonce. Lane goes out.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say. [Opens case and\\nexamines it.] However, it makes no matter, for, now that I look at the\\ninscription inside, I find that the thing isn’t yours after all.\\n\\nJACK.\\nOf course it’s mine. [Moving to him.] You have seen me with it a\\nhundred times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written\\ninside. It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette\\ncase.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should\\nread and what one shouldn’t. More than half of modern culture depends\\non what one shouldn’t read.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI am quite aware of the fact, and I don’t propose to discuss modern\\nculture. It isn’t the sort of thing one should talk of in private. I\\nsimply want my cigarette case back.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes; but this isn’t your cigarette case. This cigarette case is a\\npresent from some one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn’t\\nknow any one of that name.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYour aunt!\\n\\nJACK.\\nYes. Charming old lady she is, too. Lives at Tunbridge Wells. Just give\\nit back to me, Algy.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Retreating to back of sofa.] But why does she call herself little\\nCecily if she is your aunt and lives at Tunbridge Wells? [Reading.]\\n‘From little Cecily with her fondest love.’\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Moving to sofa and kneeling upon it.] My dear fellow, what on earth is\\nthere in that? Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall. That is a\\nmatter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself. You\\nseem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt! That is\\nabsurd! For Heaven’s sake give me back my cigarette case. [Follows\\nAlgernon round the room.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle? ‘From little Cecily,\\nwith her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.’ There is no objection, I\\nadmit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no matter what\\nher size may be, should call her own nephew her uncle, I can’t quite\\nmake out. Besides, your name isn’t Jack at all; it is Ernest.\\n\\nJACK.\\nIt isn’t Ernest; it’s Jack.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYou have always told me it was Ernest. I have introduced you to every\\none as Ernest. You answer to the name of Ernest. You look as if your\\nname was Ernest. You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in\\nmy life. It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn’t\\nErnest. It’s on your cards. Here is one of them. [Taking it from case.]\\n‘Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany.’ I’ll keep this as a proof that\\nyour name is Ernest if ever you attempt to deny it to me, or to\\nGwendolen, or to any one else. [Puts the card in his pocket.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the\\ncigarette case was given to me in the country.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, but that does not account for the fact that your small Aunt\\nCecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle. Come,\\nold boy, you had much better have the thing out at once.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMy dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist. It is very\\nvulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn’t a dentist. It produces a\\nfalse impression.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, that is exactly what dentists always do. Now, go on! Tell me the\\nwhole thing. I may mention that I have always suspected you of being a\\nconfirmed and secret Bunburyist; and I am quite sure of it now.\\n\\nJACK.\\nBunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI’ll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as soon\\nas you are kind enough to inform me why you are Ernest in town and Jack\\nin the country.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, produce my cigarette case first.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nHere it is. [Hands cigarette case.] Now produce your explanation, and\\npray make it improbable. [Sits on sofa.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nMy dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at\\nall. In fact it’s perfectly ordinary. Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who\\nadopted me when I was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his\\ngrand-daughter, Miss Cecily Cardew. Cecily, who addresses me as her\\nuncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate,\\nlives at my place in the country under the charge of her admirable\\ngoverness, Miss Prism.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWhere is that place in the country, by the way?\\n\\nJACK.\\nThat is nothing to you, dear boy. You are not going to be invited . . .\\nI may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI suspected that, my dear fellow! I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire\\non two separate occasions. Now, go on. Why are you Ernest in town and\\nJack in the country?\\n\\nJACK.\\nMy dear Algy, I don’t know whether you will be able to understand my\\nreal motives. You are hardly serious enough. When one is placed in the\\nposition of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all\\nsubjects. It’s one’s duty to do so. And as a high moral tone can hardly\\nbe said to conduce very much to either one’s health or one’s happiness,\\nin order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger\\nbrother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into\\nthe most dreadful scrapes. That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure\\nand simple.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThe truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very\\ntedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete\\nimpossibility!\\n\\nJACK.\\nThat wouldn’t be at all a bad thing.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nLiterary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow. Don’t try it. You\\nshould leave that to people who haven’t been at a University. They do\\nit so well in the daily papers. What you really are is a Bunburyist. I\\nwas quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist. You are one of the\\nmost advanced Bunburyists I know.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWhat on earth do you mean?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYou have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, in order\\nthat you may be able to come up to town as often as you like. I have\\ninvented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that\\nI may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose. Bunbury is\\nperfectly invaluable. If it wasn’t for Bunbury’s extraordinary bad\\nhealth, for instance, I wouldn’t be able to dine with you at Willis’s\\nto-night, for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than\\na week.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI haven’t asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI know. You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations. It is\\nvery foolish of you. Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving\\ninvitations.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYou had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI haven’t the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind. To\\nbegin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to\\ndine with one’s own relations. In the second place, whenever I do dine\\nthere I am always treated as a member of the family, and sent down with\\neither no woman at all, or two. In the third place, I know perfectly\\nwell whom she will place me next to, to-night. She will place me next\\nMary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband across the\\ndinner-table. That is not very pleasant. Indeed, it is not even decent\\n. . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase. The amount\\nof women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly\\nscandalous. It looks so bad. It is simply washing one’s clean linen in\\npublic. Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I\\nnaturally want to talk to you about Bunburying. I want to tell you the\\nrules.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI’m not a Bunburyist at all. If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to\\nkill my brother, indeed I think I’ll kill him in any case. Cecily is a\\nlittle too much interested in him. It is rather a bore. So I am going\\nto get rid of Ernest. And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr.\\n. . . with your invalid friend who has the absurd name.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nNothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever get\\nmarried, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad\\nto know Bunbury. A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very\\ntedious time of it.\\n\\nJACK.\\nThat is nonsense. If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, and she is\\nthe only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, I certainly\\nwon’t want to know Bunbury.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThen your wife will. You don’t seem to realise, that in married life\\nthree is company and two is none.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Sententiously.] That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the\\ncorrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time.\\n\\nJACK.\\nFor heaven’s sake, don’t try to be cynical. It’s perfectly easy to be\\ncynical.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nMy dear fellow, it isn’t easy to be anything nowadays. There’s such a\\nlot of beastly competition about. [The sound of an electric bell is\\nheard.] Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta. Only relatives, or creditors,\\never ring in that Wagnerian manner. Now, if I get her out of the way\\nfor ten minutes, so that you can have an opportunity for proposing to\\nGwendolen, may I dine with you to-night at Willis’s?\\n\\nJACK.\\nI suppose so, if you want to.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, but you must be serious about it. I hate people who are not\\nserious about meals. It is so shallow of them.\\n\\n[Enter Lane.]\\n\\nLANE.\\nLady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.\\n\\n[Algernon goes forward to meet them. Enter Lady Bracknell and\\nGwendolen.]\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nGood afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving very well.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI’m feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThat’s not quite the same thing. In fact the two things rarely go\\ntogether. [Sees Jack and bows to him with icy coldness.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[To Gwendolen.] Dear me, you are smart!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI am always smart! Am I not, Mr. Worthing?\\n\\nJACK.\\nYou’re quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nOh! I hope I am not that. It would leave no room for developments, and\\nI intend to develop in many directions. [Gwendolen and Jack sit down\\ntogether in the corner.]\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nI’m sorry if we are a little late, Algernon, but I was obliged to call\\non dear Lady Harbury. I hadn’t been there since her poor husband’s\\ndeath. I never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty years\\nyounger. And now I’ll have a cup of tea, and one of those nice cucumber\\nsandwiches you promised me.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nCertainly, Aunt Augusta. [Goes over to tea-table.]\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nWon’t you come and sit here, Gwendolen?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nThanks, mamma, I’m quite comfortable where I am.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Picking up empty plate in horror.] Good heavens! Lane! Why are there\\nno cucumber sandwiches? I ordered them specially.\\n\\nLANE.\\n[Gravely.] There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir. I\\nwent down twice.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nNo cucumbers!\\n\\nLANE.\\nNo, sir. Not even for ready money.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThat will do, Lane, thank you.\\n\\nLANE.\\nThank you, sir. [Goes out.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no cucumbers,\\nnot even for ready money.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nIt really makes no matter, Algernon. I had some crumpets with Lady\\nHarbury, who seems to me to be living entirely for pleasure now.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nIt certainly has changed its colour. From what cause I, of course,\\ncannot say. [Algernon crosses and hands tea.] Thank you. I’ve quite a\\ntreat for you to-night, Algernon. I am going to send you down with Mary\\nFarquhar. She is such a nice woman, and so attentive to her husband.\\nIt’s delightful to watch them.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give up the pleasure of\\ndining with you to-night after all.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Frowning.] I hope not, Algernon. It would put my table completely out.\\nYour uncle would have to dine upstairs. Fortunately he is accustomed to\\nthat.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIt is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible disappointment\\nto me, but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say that my poor\\nfriend Bunbury is very ill again. [Exchanges glances with Jack.] They\\nseem to think I should be with him.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nIt is very strange. This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer from curiously bad\\nhealth.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nWell, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr.\\nBunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die. This\\nshilly-shallying with the question is absurd. Nor do I in any way\\napprove of the modern sympathy with invalids. I consider it morbid.\\nIllness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.\\nHealth is the primary duty of life. I am always telling that to your\\npoor uncle, but he never seems to take much notice . . . as far as any\\nimprovement in his ailment goes. I should be much obliged if you would\\nask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse on\\nSaturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me. It is my last\\nreception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation,\\nparticularly at the end of the season when every one has practically\\nsaid whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably not\\nmuch.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI’ll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious, and I\\nthink I can promise you he’ll be all right by Saturday. Of course the\\nmusic is a great difficulty. You see, if one plays good music, people\\ndon’t listen, and if one plays bad music people don’t talk. But I’ll\\nrun over the programme I’ve drawn out, if you will kindly come into the\\nnext room for a moment.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThank you, Algernon. It is very thoughtful of you. [Rising, and\\nfollowing Algernon.] I’m sure the programme will be delightful, after a\\nfew expurgations. French songs I cannot possibly allow. People always\\nseem to think that they are improper, and either look shocked, which is\\nvulgar, or laugh, which is worse. But German sounds a thoroughly\\nrespectable language, and indeed, I believe is so. Gwendolen, you will\\naccompany me.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nCertainly, mamma.\\n\\n[Lady Bracknell and Algernon go into the music-room, Gwendolen remains\\nbehind.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nCharming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nPray don’t talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing. Whenever people\\ntalk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain that they\\nmean something else. And that makes me so nervous.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI _do_ mean something else.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI thought so. In fact, I am never wrong.\\n\\nJACK.\\nAnd I would like to be allowed to take advantage of Lady Bracknell’s\\ntemporary absence . . .\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI would certainly advise you to do so. Mamma has a way of coming back\\nsuddenly into a room that I have often had to speak to her about.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Nervously.] Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you more\\nthan any girl . . . I have ever met since . . . I met you.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nYes, I am quite well aware of the fact. And I often wish that in\\npublic, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative. For me you have\\nalways had an irresistible fascination. Even before I met you I was far\\nfrom indifferent to you. [Jack looks at her in amazement.] We live, as\\nI hope you know, Mr. Worthing, in an age of ideals. The fact is\\nconstantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines, and has\\nreached the provincial pulpits, I am told; and my ideal has always been\\nto love some one of the name of Ernest. There is something in that name\\nthat inspires absolute confidence. The moment Algernon first mentioned\\nto me that he had a friend called Ernest, I knew I was destined to love\\nyou.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYou really love me, Gwendolen?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nPassionately!\\n\\nJACK.\\nDarling! You don’t know how happy you’ve made me.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nMy own Ernest!\\n\\nJACK.\\nBut you don’t really mean to say that you couldn’t love me if my name\\nwasn’t Ernest?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nBut your name is Ernest.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYes, I know it is. But supposing it was something else? Do you mean to\\nsay you couldn’t love me then?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Glibly.] Ah! that is clearly a metaphysical speculation, and like most\\nmetaphysical speculations has very little reference at all to the\\nactual facts of real life, as we know them.\\n\\nJACK.\\nPersonally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I don’t much care about\\nthe name of Ernest . . . I don’t think the name suits me at all.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nIt suits you perfectly. It is a divine name. It has a music of its own.\\nIt produces vibrations.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think there are lots of\\nother much nicer names. I think Jack, for instance, a charming name.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nJack? . . . No, there is very little music in the name Jack, if any at\\nall, indeed. It does not thrill. It produces absolutely no vibrations .\\n. . I have known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were\\nmore than usually plain. Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for\\nJohn! And I pity any woman who is married to a man called John. She\\nwould probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a\\nsingle moment’s solitude. The only really safe name is Ernest.\\n\\nJACK.\\nGwendolen, I must get christened at once—I mean we must get married at\\nonce. There is no time to be lost.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nMarried, Mr. Worthing?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Astounded.] Well . . . surely. You know that I love you, and you led\\nme to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you were not absolutely indifferent\\nto me.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI adore you. But you haven’t proposed to me yet. Nothing has been said\\nat all about marriage. The subject has not even been touched on.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell . . . may I propose to you now?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI think it would be an admirable opportunity. And to spare you any\\npossible disappointment, Mr. Worthing, I think it only fair to tell you\\nquite frankly before-hand that I am fully determined to accept you.\\n\\nJACK.\\nGwendolen!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nYes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say to me?\\n\\nJACK.\\nYou know what I have got to say to you.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nYes, but you don’t say it.\\n\\nJACK.\\nGwendolen, will you marry me? [Goes on his knees.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nOf course I will, darling. How long you have been about it! I am afraid\\nyou have had very little experience in how to propose.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMy own one, I have never loved any one in the world but you.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nYes, but men often propose for practice. I know my brother Gerald does.\\nAll my girl-friends tell me so. What wonderfully blue eyes you have,\\nErnest! They are quite, quite, blue. I hope you will always look at me\\njust like that, especially when there are other people present. [Enter\\nLady Bracknell.]\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nMr. Worthing! Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent posture. It is most\\nindecorous.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nMamma! [He tries to rise; she restrains him.] I must beg you to retire.\\nThis is no place for you. Besides, Mr. Worthing has not quite finished\\nyet.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nFinished what, may I ask?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma. [They rise together.]\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nPardon me, you are not engaged to any one. When you do become engaged\\nto some one, I, or your father, should his health permit him, will\\ninform you of the fact. An engagement should come on a young girl as a\\nsurprise, pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be. It is hardly a\\nmatter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself . . . And now I\\nhave a few questions to put to you, Mr. Worthing. While I am making\\nthese inquiries, you, Gwendolen, will wait for me below in the\\ncarriage.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Reproachfully.] Mamma!\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nIn the carriage, Gwendolen! [Gwendolen goes to the door. She and Jack\\nblow kisses to each other behind Lady Bracknell’s back. Lady Bracknell\\nlooks vaguely about as if she could not understand what the noise was.\\nFinally turns round.] Gwendolen, the carriage!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nYes, mamma. [Goes out, looking back at Jack.]\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Sitting down.] You can take a seat, Mr. Worthing.\\n\\n[Looks in her pocket for note-book and pencil.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nThank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Pencil and note-book in hand.] I feel bound to tell you that you are\\nnot down on my list of eligible young men, although I have the same\\nlist as the dear Duchess of Bolton has. We work together, in fact.\\nHowever, I am quite ready to enter your name, should your answers be\\nwhat a really affectionate mother requires. Do you smoke?\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, yes, I must admit I smoke.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nI am glad to hear it. A man should always have an occupation of some\\nkind. There are far too many idle men in London as it is. How old are\\nyou?\\n\\nJACK.\\nTwenty-nine.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nA very good age to be married at. I have always been of opinion that a\\nman who desires to get married should know either everything or\\nnothing. Which do you know?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[After some hesitation.] I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nI am pleased to hear it. I do not approve of anything that tampers with\\nnatural ignorance. Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it\\nand the bloom is gone. The whole theory of modern education is\\nradically unsound. Fortunately in England, at any rate, education\\nproduces no effect whatsoever. If it did, it would prove a serious\\ndanger to the upper classes, and probably lead to acts of violence in\\nGrosvenor Square. What is your income?\\n\\nJACK.\\nBetween seven and eight thousand a year.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Makes a note in her book.] In land, or in investments?\\n\\nJACK.\\nIn investments, chiefly.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThat is satisfactory. What between the duties expected of one during\\none’s lifetime, and the duties exacted from one after one’s death, land\\nhas ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure. It gives one position,\\nand prevents one from keeping it up. That’s all that can be said about\\nland.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI have a country house with some land, of course, attached to it, about\\nfifteen hundred acres, I believe; but I don’t depend on that for my\\nreal income. In fact, as far as I can make out, the poachers are the\\nonly people who make anything out of it.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nA country house! How many bedrooms? Well, that point can be cleared up\\nafterwards. You have a town house, I hope? A girl with a simple,\\nunspoiled nature, like Gwendolen, could hardly be expected to reside in\\nthe country.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it is let by the year to\\nLady Bloxham. Of course, I can get it back whenever I like, at six\\nmonths’ notice.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nLady Bloxham? I don’t know her.\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, she goes about very little. She is a lady considerably advanced in\\nyears.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nAh, nowadays that is no guarantee of respectability of character. What\\nnumber in Belgrave Square?\\n\\nJACK.\\n149.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Shaking her head.] The unfashionable side. I thought there was\\nsomething. However, that could easily be altered.\\n\\nJACK.\\nDo you mean the fashion, or the side?\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Sternly.] Both, if necessary, I presume. What are your politics?\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, I am afraid I really have none. I am a Liberal Unionist.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nOh, they count as Tories. They dine with us. Or come in the evening, at\\nany rate. Now to minor matters. Are your parents living?\\n\\nJACK.\\nI have lost both my parents.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nTo lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune; to\\nlose both looks like carelessness. Who was your father? He was\\nevidently a man of some wealth. Was he born in what the Radical papers\\ncall the purple of commerce, or did he rise from the ranks of the\\naristocracy?\\n\\nJACK.\\nI am afraid I really don’t know. The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I said I\\nhad lost my parents. It would be nearer the truth to say that my\\nparents seem to have lost me . . . I don’t actually know who I am by\\nbirth. I was . . . well, I was found.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nFound!\\n\\nJACK.\\nThe late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman of a very charitable and\\nkindly disposition, found me, and gave me the name of Worthing, because\\nhe happened to have a first-class ticket for Worthing in his pocket at\\nthe time. Worthing is a place in Sussex. It is a seaside resort.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nWhere did the charitable gentleman who had a first-class ticket for\\nthis seaside resort find you?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Gravely.] In a hand-bag.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nA hand-bag?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Very seriously.] Yes, Lady Bracknell. I was in a hand-bag—a somewhat\\nlarge, black leather hand-bag, with handles to it—an ordinary hand-bag\\nin fact.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nIn what locality did this Mr. James, or Thomas, Cardew come across this\\nordinary hand-bag?\\n\\nJACK.\\nIn the cloak-room at Victoria Station. It was given to him in mistake\\nfor his own.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThe cloak-room at Victoria Station?\\n\\nJACK.\\nYes. The Brighton line.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThe line is immaterial. Mr. Worthing, I confess I feel somewhat\\nbewildered by what you have just told me. To be born, or at any rate\\nbred, in a hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to\\ndisplay a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that\\nreminds one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution. And I\\npresume you know what that unfortunate movement led to? As for the\\nparticular locality in which the hand-bag was found, a cloak-room at a\\nrailway station might serve to conceal a social indiscretion—has\\nprobably, indeed, been used for that purpose before now—but it could\\nhardly be regarded as an assured basis for a recognised position in\\ngood society.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMay I ask you then what you would advise me to do? I need hardly say I\\nwould do anything in the world to ensure Gwendolen’s happiness.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nI would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing, to try and acquire some\\nrelations as soon as possible, and to make a definite effort to produce\\nat any rate one parent, of either sex, before the season is quite over.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, I don’t see how I could possibly manage to do that. I can produce\\nthe hand-bag at any moment. It is in my dressing-room at home. I really\\nthink that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nMe, sir! What has it to do with me? You can hardly imagine that I and\\nLord Bracknell would dream of allowing our only daughter—a girl brought\\nup with the utmost care—to marry into a cloak-room, and form an\\nalliance with a parcel? Good morning, Mr. Worthing!\\n\\n[Lady Bracknell sweeps out in majestic indignation.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nGood morning! [Algernon, from the other room, strikes up the Wedding\\nMarch. Jack looks perfectly furious, and goes to the door.] For\\ngoodness’ sake don’t play that ghastly tune, Algy. How idiotic you are!\\n\\n[The music stops and Algernon enters cheerily.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nDidn’t it go off all right, old boy? You don’t mean to say Gwendolen\\nrefused you? I know it is a way she has. She is always refusing people.\\nI think it is most ill-natured of her.\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, Gwendolen is as right as a trivet. As far as she is concerned, we\\nare engaged. Her mother is perfectly unbearable. Never met such a\\nGorgon . . . I don’t really know what a Gorgon is like, but I am quite\\nsure that Lady Bracknell is one. In any case, she is a monster, without\\nbeing a myth, which is rather unfair . . . I beg your pardon, Algy, I\\nsuppose I shouldn’t talk about your own aunt in that way before you.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nMy dear boy, I love hearing my relations abused. It is the only thing\\nthat makes me put up with them at all. Relations are simply a tedious\\npack of people, who haven’t got the remotest knowledge of how to live,\\nnor the smallest instinct about when to die.\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, that is nonsense!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIt isn’t!\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, I won’t argue about the matter. You always want to argue about\\nthings.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThat is exactly what things were originally made for.\\n\\nJACK.\\nUpon my word, if I thought that, I’d shoot myself . . . [A pause.] You\\ndon’t think there is any chance of Gwendolen becoming like her mother\\nin about a hundred and fifty years, do you, Algy?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nAll women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man\\ndoes. That’s his.\\n\\nJACK.\\nIs that clever?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIt is perfectly phrased! and quite as true as any observation in\\ncivilised life should be.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI am sick to death of cleverness. Everybody is clever nowadays. You\\ncan’t go anywhere without meeting clever people. The thing has become\\nan absolute public nuisance. I wish to goodness we had a few fools\\nleft.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWe have.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI should extremely like to meet them. What do they talk about?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThe fools? Oh! about the clever people, of course.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWhat fools!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBy the way, did you tell Gwendolen the truth about your being Ernest in\\ntown, and Jack in the country?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[In a very patronising manner.] My dear fellow, the truth isn’t quite\\nthe sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl. What\\nextraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThe only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her, if she is\\npretty, and to some one else, if she is plain.\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, that is nonsense.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWhat about your brother? What about the profligate Ernest?\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, before the end of the week I shall have got rid of him. I’ll say he\\ndied in Paris of apoplexy. Lots of people die of apoplexy, quite\\nsuddenly, don’t they?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, but it’s hereditary, my dear fellow. It’s a sort of thing that\\nruns in families. You had much better say a severe chill.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYou are sure a severe chill isn’t hereditary, or anything of that kind?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOf course it isn’t!\\n\\nJACK.\\nVery well, then. My poor brother Ernest is carried off suddenly, in\\nParis, by a severe chill. That gets rid of him.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBut I thought you said that . . . Miss Cardew was a little too much\\ninterested in your poor brother Ernest? Won’t she feel his loss a good\\ndeal?\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, that is all right. Cecily is not a silly romantic girl, I am glad\\nto say. She has got a capital appetite, goes long walks, and pays no\\nattention at all to her lessons.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI would rather like to see Cecily.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI will take very good care you never do. She is excessively pretty, and\\nshe is only just eighteen.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nHave you told Gwendolen yet that you have an excessively pretty ward\\nwho is only just eighteen?\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh! one doesn’t blurt these things out to people. Cecily and Gwendolen\\nare perfectly certain to be extremely great friends. I’ll bet you\\nanything you like that half an hour after they have met, they will be\\ncalling each other sister.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWomen only do that when they have called each other a lot of other\\nthings first. Now, my dear boy, if we want to get a good table at\\nWillis’s, we really must go and dress. Do you know it is nearly seven?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Irritably.] Oh! It always is nearly seven.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, I’m hungry.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI never knew you when you weren’t . . .\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWhat shall we do after dinner? Go to a theatre?\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh no! I loathe listening.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, let us go to the Club?\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, no! I hate talking.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, we might trot round to the Empire at ten?\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, no! I can’t bear looking at things. It is so silly.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, what shall we do?\\n\\nJACK.\\nNothing!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIt is awfully hard work doing nothing. However, I don’t mind hard work\\nwhere there is no definite object of any kind.\\n\\n[Enter Lane.]\\n\\nLANE.\\nMiss Fairfax.\\n\\n[Enter Gwendolen. Lane goes out.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nGwendolen, upon my word!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nAlgy, kindly turn your back. I have something very particular to say to\\nMr. Worthing.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nReally, Gwendolen, I don’t think I can allow this at all.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nAlgy, you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towards life. You\\nare not quite old enough to do that. [Algernon retires to the\\nfireplace.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nMy own darling!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nErnest, we may never be married. From the expression on mamma’s face I\\nfear we never shall. Few parents nowadays pay any regard to what their\\nchildren say to them. The old-fashioned respect for the young is fast\\ndying out. Whatever influence I ever had over mamma, I lost at the age\\nof three. But although she may prevent us from becoming man and wife,\\nand I may marry some one else, and marry often, nothing that she can\\npossibly do can alter my eternal devotion to you.\\n\\nJACK.\\nDear Gwendolen!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nThe story of your romantic origin, as related to me by mamma, with\\nunpleasing comments, has naturally stirred the deeper fibres of my\\nnature. Your Christian name has an irresistible fascination. The\\nsimplicity of your character makes you exquisitely incomprehensible to\\nme. Your town address at the Albany I have. What is your address in the\\ncountry?\\n\\nJACK.\\nThe Manor House, Woolton, Hertfordshire.\\n\\n[Algernon, who has been carefully listening, smiles to himself, and\\nwrites the address on his shirt-cuff. Then picks up the Railway Guide.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nThere is a good postal service, I suppose? It may be necessary to do\\nsomething desperate. That of course will require serious consideration.\\nI will communicate with you daily.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMy own one!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nHow long do you remain in town?\\n\\nJACK.\\nTill Monday.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nGood! Algy, you may turn round now.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThanks, I’ve turned round already.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nYou may also ring the bell.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYou will let me see you to your carriage, my own darling?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nCertainly.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[To Lane, who now enters.] I will see Miss Fairfax out.\\n\\nLANE.\\nYes, sir. [Jack and Gwendolen go off.]\\n\\n[Lane presents several letters on a salver to Algernon. It is to be\\nsurmised that they are bills, as Algernon, after looking at the\\nenvelopes, tears them up.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nA glass of sherry, Lane.\\n\\nLANE.\\nYes, sir.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nTo-morrow, Lane, I’m going Bunburying.\\n\\nLANE.\\nYes, sir.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI shall probably not be back till Monday. You can put up my dress\\nclothes, my smoking jacket, and all the Bunbury suits . . .\\n\\nLANE.\\nYes, sir. [Handing sherry.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI hope to-morrow will be a fine day, Lane.\\n\\nLANE.\\nIt never is, sir.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nLane, you’re a perfect pessimist.\\n\\nLANE.\\nI do my best to give satisfaction, sir.\\n\\n[Enter Jack. Lane goes off.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nThere’s a sensible, intellectual girl! the only girl I ever cared for\\nin my life. [Algernon is laughing immoderately.] What on earth are you\\nso amused at?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOh, I’m a little anxious about poor Bunbury, that is all.\\n\\nJACK.\\nIf you don’t take care, your friend Bunbury will get you into a serious\\nscrape some day.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI love scrapes. They are the only things that are never serious.\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, that’s nonsense, Algy. You never talk anything but nonsense.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nNobody ever does.\\n\\n[Jack looks indignantly at him, and leaves the room. Algernon lights a\\ncigarette, reads his shirt-cuff, and smiles.]\\n\\nACT DROP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSECOND ACT\\n\\n\\nSCENE\\n\\nGarden at the Manor House. A flight of grey stone steps leads up to the\\nhouse. The garden, an old-fashioned one, full of roses. Time of year,\\nJuly. Basket chairs, and a table covered with books, are set under a\\nlarge yew-tree.\\n\\n[Miss Prism discovered seated at the table. Cecily is at the back\\nwatering flowers.]\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Calling.] Cecily, Cecily! Surely such a utilitarian occupation as the\\nwatering of flowers is rather Moulton’s duty than yours? Especially at\\na moment when intellectual pleasures await you. Your German grammar is\\non the table. Pray open it at page fifteen. We will repeat yesterday’s\\nlesson.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Coming over very slowly.] But I don’t like German. It isn’t at all a\\nbecoming language. I know perfectly well that I look quite plain after\\nmy German lesson.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nChild, you know how anxious your guardian is that you should improve\\nyourself in every way. He laid particular stress on your German, as he\\nwas leaving for town yesterday. Indeed, he always lays stress on your\\nGerman when he is leaving for town.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nDear Uncle Jack is so very serious! Sometimes he is so serious that I\\nthink he cannot be quite well.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Drawing herself up.] Your guardian enjoys the best of health, and his\\ngravity of demeanour is especially to be commended in one so\\ncomparatively young as he is. I know no one who has a higher sense of\\nduty and responsibility.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI suppose that is why he often looks a little bored when we three are\\ntogether.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nCecily! I am surprised at you. Mr. Worthing has many troubles in his\\nlife. Idle merriment and triviality would be out of place in his\\nconversation. You must remember his constant anxiety about that\\nunfortunate young man his brother.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI wish Uncle Jack would allow that unfortunate young man, his brother,\\nto come down here sometimes. We might have a good influence over him,\\nMiss Prism. I am sure you certainly would. You know German, and\\ngeology, and things of that kind influence a man very much. [Cecily\\nbegins to write in her diary.]\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Shaking her head.] I do not think that even I could produce any effect\\non a character that according to his own brother’s admission is\\nirretrievably weak and vacillating. Indeed I am not sure that I would\\ndesire to reclaim him. I am not in favour of this modern mania for\\nturning bad people into good people at a moment’s notice. As a man sows\\nso let him reap. You must put away your diary, Cecily. I really don’t\\nsee why you should keep a diary at all.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my life. If I\\ndidn’t write them down, I should probably forget all about them.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nMemory, my dear Cecily, is the diary that we all carry about with us.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYes, but it usually chronicles the things that have never happened, and\\ncouldn’t possibly have happened. I believe that Memory is responsible\\nfor nearly all the three-volume novels that Mudie sends us.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nDo not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, Cecily. I wrote one\\nmyself in earlier days.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nDid you really, Miss Prism? How wonderfully clever you are! I hope it\\ndid not end happily? I don’t like novels that end happily. They depress\\nme so much.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nThe good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. That is what Fiction\\nmeans.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI suppose so. But it seems very unfair. And was your novel ever\\npublished?\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nAlas! no. The manuscript unfortunately was abandoned. [Cecily starts.]\\nI use the word in the sense of lost or mislaid. To your work, child,\\nthese speculations are profitless.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Smiling.] But I see dear Dr. Chasuble coming up through the garden.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Rising and advancing.] Dr. Chasuble! This is indeed a pleasure.\\n\\n[Enter Canon Chasuble.]\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nAnd how are we this morning? Miss Prism, you are, I trust, well?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nMiss Prism has just been complaining of a slight headache. I think it\\nwould do her so much good to have a short stroll with you in the Park,\\nDr. Chasuble.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nCecily, I have not mentioned anything about a headache.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nNo, dear Miss Prism, I know that, but I felt instinctively that you had\\na headache. Indeed I was thinking about that, and not about my German\\nlesson, when the Rector came in.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nI hope, Cecily, you are not inattentive.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh, I am afraid I am.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nThat is strange. Were I fortunate enough to be Miss Prism’s pupil, I\\nwould hang upon her lips. [Miss Prism glares.] I spoke\\nmetaphorically.—My metaphor was drawn from bees. Ahem! Mr. Worthing, I\\nsuppose, has not returned from town yet?\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nWe do not expect him till Monday afternoon.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nAh yes, he usually likes to spend his Sunday in London. He is not one\\nof those whose sole aim is enjoyment, as, by all accounts, that\\nunfortunate young man his brother seems to be. But I must not disturb\\nEgeria and her pupil any longer.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nEgeria? My name is Lætitia, Doctor.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\n[Bowing.] A classical allusion merely, drawn from the Pagan authors. I\\nshall see you both no doubt at Evensong?\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nI think, dear Doctor, I will have a stroll with you. I find I have a\\nheadache after all, and a walk might do it good.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nWith pleasure, Miss Prism, with pleasure. We might go as far as the\\nschools and back.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nThat would be delightful. Cecily, you will read your Political Economy\\nin my absence. The chapter on the Fall of the Rupee you may omit. It is\\nsomewhat too sensational. Even these metallic problems have their\\nmelodramatic side.\\n\\n[Goes down the garden with Dr. Chasuble.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Picks up books and throws them back on table.] Horrid Political\\nEconomy! Horrid Geography! Horrid, horrid German!\\n\\n[Enter Merriman with a card on a salver.]\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nMr. Ernest Worthing has just driven over from the station. He has\\nbrought his luggage with him.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Takes the card and reads it.] ‘Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany,\\nW.’ Uncle Jack’s brother! Did you tell him Mr. Worthing was in town?\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nYes, Miss. He seemed very much disappointed. I mentioned that you and\\nMiss Prism were in the garden. He said he was anxious to speak to you\\nprivately for a moment.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nAsk Mr. Ernest Worthing to come here. I suppose you had better talk to\\nthe housekeeper about a room for him.\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nYes, Miss.\\n\\n[Merriman goes off.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI have never met any really wicked person before. I feel rather\\nfrightened. I am so afraid he will look just like every one else.\\n\\n[Enter Algernon, very gay and debonnair.] He does!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Raising his hat.] You are my little cousin Cecily, I’m sure.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYou are under some strange mistake. I am not little. In fact, I believe\\nI am more than usually tall for my age. [Algernon is rather taken\\naback.] But I am your cousin Cecily. You, I see from your card, are\\nUncle Jack’s brother, my cousin Ernest, my wicked cousin Ernest.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOh! I am not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily. You mustn’t think\\nthat I am wicked.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nIf you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in a very\\ninexcusable manner. I hope you have not been leading a double life,\\npretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. That would\\nbe hypocrisy.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Looks at her in amazement.] Oh! Of course I have been rather reckless.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI am glad to hear it.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIn fact, now you mention the subject, I have been very bad in my own\\nsmall way.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI don’t think you should be so proud of that, though I am sure it must\\nhave been very pleasant.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIt is much pleasanter being here with you.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI can’t understand how you are here at all. Uncle Jack won’t be back\\ntill Monday afternoon.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThat is a great disappointment. I am obliged to go up by the first\\ntrain on Monday morning. I have a business appointment that I am\\nanxious . . . to miss?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nCouldn’t you miss it anywhere but in London?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nNo: the appointment is in London.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nWell, I know, of course, how important it is not to keep a business\\nengagement, if one wants to retain any sense of the beauty of life, but\\nstill I think you had better wait till Uncle Jack arrives. I know he\\nwants to speak to you about your emigrating.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nAbout my what?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYour emigrating. He has gone up to buy your outfit.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI certainly wouldn’t let Jack buy my outfit. He has no taste in\\nneckties at all.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI don’t think you will require neckties. Uncle Jack is sending you to\\nAustralia.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nAustralia! I’d sooner die.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nWell, he said at dinner on Wednesday night, that you would have to\\nchoose between this world, the next world, and Australia.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOh, well! The accounts I have received of Australia and the next world,\\nare not particularly encouraging. This world is good enough for me,\\ncousin Cecily.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYes, but are you good enough for it?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI’m afraid I’m not that. That is why I want you to reform me. You might\\nmake that your mission, if you don’t mind, cousin Cecily.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI’m afraid I’ve no time, this afternoon.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, would you mind my reforming myself this afternoon?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nIt is rather Quixotic of you. But I think you should try.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI will. I feel better already.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYou are looking a little worse.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThat is because I am hungry.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nHow thoughtless of me. I should have remembered that when one is going\\nto lead an entirely new life, one requires regular and wholesome meals.\\nWon’t you come in?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThank you. Might I have a buttonhole first? I never have any appetite\\nunless I have a buttonhole first.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nA Marechal Niel? [Picks up scissors.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nNo, I’d sooner have a pink rose.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nWhy? [Cuts a flower.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBecause you are like a pink rose, Cousin Cecily.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI don’t think it can be right for you to talk to me like that. Miss\\nPrism never says such things to me.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThen Miss Prism is a short-sighted old lady. [Cecily puts the rose in\\nhis buttonhole.] You are the prettiest girl I ever saw.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nMiss Prism says that all good looks are a snare.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThey are a snare that every sensible man would like to be caught in.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh, I don’t think I would care to catch a sensible man. I shouldn’t\\nknow what to talk to him about.\\n\\n[They pass into the house. Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble return.]\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nYou are too much alone, dear Dr. Chasuble. You should get married. A\\nmisanthrope I can understand—a womanthrope, never!\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\n[With a scholar’s shudder.] Believe me, I do not deserve so neologistic\\na phrase. The precept as well as the practice of the Primitive Church\\nwas distinctly against matrimony.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Sententiously.] That is obviously the reason why the Primitive Church\\nhas not lasted up to the present day. And you do not seem to realise,\\ndear Doctor, that by persistently remaining single, a man converts\\nhimself into a permanent public temptation. Men should be more careful;\\nthis very celibacy leads weaker vessels astray.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nBut is a man not equally attractive when married?\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nNo married man is ever attractive except to his wife.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nAnd often, I’ve been told, not even to her.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nThat depends on the intellectual sympathies of the woman. Maturity can\\nalways be depended on. Ripeness can be trusted. Young women are green.\\n[Dr. Chasuble starts.] I spoke horticulturally. My metaphor was drawn\\nfrom fruits. But where is Cecily?\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nPerhaps she followed us to the schools.\\n\\n[Enter Jack slowly from the back of the garden. He is dressed in the\\ndeepest mourning, with crape hatband and black gloves.]\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nMr. Worthing!\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nMr. Worthing?\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nThis is indeed a surprise. We did not look for you till Monday\\nafternoon.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Shakes Miss Prism’s hand in a tragic manner.] I have returned sooner\\nthan I expected. Dr. Chasuble, I hope you are well?\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nDear Mr. Worthing, I trust this garb of woe does not betoken some\\nterrible calamity?\\n\\nJACK.\\nMy brother.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nMore shameful debts and extravagance?\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nStill leading his life of pleasure?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Shaking his head.] Dead!\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nYour brother Ernest dead?\\n\\nJACK.\\nQuite dead.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nWhat a lesson for him! I trust he will profit by it.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nMr. Worthing, I offer you my sincere condolence. You have at least the\\nconsolation of knowing that you were always the most generous and\\nforgiving of brothers.\\n\\nJACK.\\nPoor Ernest! He had many faults, but it is a sad, sad blow.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nVery sad indeed. Were you with him at the end?\\n\\nJACK.\\nNo. He died abroad; in Paris, in fact. I had a telegram last night from\\nthe manager of the Grand Hotel.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nWas the cause of death mentioned?\\n\\nJACK.\\nA severe chill, it seems.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nAs a man sows, so shall he reap.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\n[Raising his hand.] Charity, dear Miss Prism, charity! None of us are\\nperfect. I myself am peculiarly susceptible to draughts. Will the\\ninterment take place here?\\n\\nJACK.\\nNo. He seems to have expressed a desire to be buried in Paris.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nIn Paris! [Shakes his head.] I fear that hardly points to any very\\nserious state of mind at the last. You would no doubt wish me to make\\nsome slight allusion to this tragic domestic affliction next Sunday.\\n[Jack presses his hand convulsively.] My sermon on the meaning of the\\nmanna in the wilderness can be adapted to almost any occasion, joyful,\\nor, as in the present case, distressing. [All sigh.] I have preached it\\nat harvest celebrations, christenings, confirmations, on days of\\nhumiliation and festal days. The last time I delivered it was in the\\nCathedral, as a charity sermon on behalf of the Society for the\\nPrevention of Discontent among the Upper Orders. The Bishop, who was\\npresent, was much struck by some of the analogies I drew.\\n\\nJACK.\\nAh! that reminds me, you mentioned christenings I think, Dr. Chasuble?\\nI suppose you know how to christen all right? [Dr. Chasuble looks\\nastounded.] I mean, of course, you are continually christening, aren’t\\nyou?\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nIt is, I regret to say, one of the Rector’s most constant duties in\\nthis parish. I have often spoken to the poorer classes on the subject.\\nBut they don’t seem to know what thrift is.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nBut is there any particular infant in whom you are interested, Mr.\\nWorthing? Your brother was, I believe, unmarried, was he not?\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh yes.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Bitterly.] People who live entirely for pleasure usually are.\\n\\nJACK.\\nBut it is not for any child, dear Doctor. I am very fond of children.\\nNo! the fact is, I would like to be christened myself, this afternoon,\\nif you have nothing better to do.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nBut surely, Mr. Worthing, you have been christened already?\\n\\nJACK.\\nI don’t remember anything about it.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nBut have you any grave doubts on the subject?\\n\\nJACK.\\nI certainly intend to have. Of course I don’t know if the thing would\\nbother you in any way, or if you think I am a little too old now.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nNot at all. The sprinkling, and, indeed, the immersion of adults is a\\nperfectly canonical practice.\\n\\nJACK.\\nImmersion!\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nYou need have no apprehensions. Sprinkling is all that is necessary, or\\nindeed I think advisable. Our weather is so changeable. At what hour\\nwould you wish the ceremony performed?\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh, I might trot round about five if that would suit you.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nPerfectly, perfectly! In fact I have two similar ceremonies to perform\\nat that time. A case of twins that occurred recently in one of the\\noutlying cottages on your own estate. Poor Jenkins the carter, a most\\nhard-working man.\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh! I don’t see much fun in being christened along with other babies.\\nIt would be childish. Would half-past five do?\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nAdmirably! Admirably! [Takes out watch.] And now, dear Mr. Worthing, I\\nwill not intrude any longer into a house of sorrow. I would merely beg\\nyou not to be too much bowed down by grief. What seem to us bitter\\ntrials are often blessings in disguise.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nThis seems to me a blessing of an extremely obvious kind.\\n\\n[Enter Cecily from the house.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nUncle Jack! Oh, I am pleased to see you back. But what horrid clothes\\nyou have got on! Do go and change them.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nCecily!\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nMy child! my child! [Cecily goes towards Jack; he kisses her brow in a\\nmelancholy manner.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nWhat is the matter, Uncle Jack? Do look happy! You look as if you had\\ntoothache, and I have got such a surprise for you. Who do you think is\\nin the dining-room? Your brother!\\n\\nJACK.\\nWho?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYour brother Ernest. He arrived about half an hour ago.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWhat nonsense! I haven’t got a brother.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh, don’t say that. However badly he may have behaved to you in the\\npast he is still your brother. You couldn’t be so heartless as to\\ndisown him. I’ll tell him to come out. And you will shake hands with\\nhim, won’t you, Uncle Jack? [Runs back into the house.]\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nThese are very joyful tidings.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nAfter we had all been resigned to his loss, his sudden return seems to\\nme peculiarly distressing.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMy brother is in the dining-room? I don’t know what it all means. I\\nthink it is perfectly absurd.\\n\\n[Enter Algernon and Cecily hand in hand. They come slowly up to Jack.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nGood heavens! [Motions Algernon away.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBrother John, I have come down from town to tell you that I am very\\nsorry for all the trouble I have given you, and that I intend to lead a\\nbetter life in the future. [Jack glares at him and does not take his\\nhand.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nUncle Jack, you are not going to refuse your own brother’s hand?\\n\\nJACK.\\nNothing will induce me to take his hand. I think his coming down here\\ndisgraceful. He knows perfectly well why.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nUncle Jack, do be nice. There is some good in every one. Ernest has\\njust been telling me about his poor invalid friend Mr. Bunbury whom he\\ngoes to visit so often. And surely there must be much good in one who\\nis kind to an invalid, and leaves the pleasures of London to sit by a\\nbed of pain.\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh! he has been talking about Bunbury, has he?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYes, he has told me all about poor Mr. Bunbury, and his terrible state\\nof health.\\n\\nJACK.\\nBunbury! Well, I won’t have him talk to you about Bunbury or about\\nanything else. It is enough to drive one perfectly frantic.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOf course I admit that the faults were all on my side. But I must say\\nthat I think that Brother John’s coldness to me is peculiarly painful.\\nI expected a more enthusiastic welcome, especially considering it is\\nthe first time I have come here.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nUncle Jack, if you don’t shake hands with Ernest I will never forgive\\nyou.\\n\\nJACK.\\nNever forgive me?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nNever, never, never!\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, this is the last time I shall ever do it. [Shakes with Algernon\\nand glares.]\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nIt’s pleasant, is it not, to see so perfect a reconciliation? I think\\nwe might leave the two brothers together.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nCecily, you will come with us.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nCertainly, Miss Prism. My little task of reconciliation is over.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nYou have done a beautiful action to-day, dear child.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nWe must not be premature in our judgments.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI feel very happy. [They all go off except Jack and Algernon.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nYou young scoundrel, Algy, you must get out of this place as soon as\\npossible. I don’t allow any Bunburying here.\\n\\n[Enter Merriman.]\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nI have put Mr. Ernest’s things in the room next to yours, sir. I\\nsuppose that is all right?\\n\\nJACK.\\nWhat?\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nMr. Ernest’s luggage, sir. I have unpacked it and put it in the room\\nnext to your own.\\n\\nJACK.\\nHis luggage?\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nYes, sir. Three portmanteaus, a dressing-case, two hat-boxes, and a\\nlarge luncheon-basket.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI am afraid I can’t stay more than a week this time.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMerriman, order the dog-cart at once. Mr. Ernest has been suddenly\\ncalled back to town.\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nYes, sir. [Goes back into the house.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWhat a fearful liar you are, Jack. I have not been called back to town\\nat all.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYes, you have.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI haven’t heard any one call me.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYour duty as a gentleman calls you back.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nMy duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures in the\\nsmallest degree.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI can quite understand that.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, Cecily is a darling.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYou are not to talk of Miss Cardew like that. I don’t like it.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, I don’t like your clothes. You look perfectly ridiculous in them.\\nWhy on earth don’t you go up and change? It is perfectly childish to be\\nin deep mourning for a man who is actually staying for a whole week\\nwith you in your house as a guest. I call it grotesque.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYou are certainly not staying with me for a whole week as a guest or\\nanything else. You have got to leave . . . by the four-five train.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI certainly won’t leave you so long as you are in mourning. It would be\\nmost unfriendly. If I were in mourning you would stay with me, I\\nsuppose. I should think it very unkind if you didn’t.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, will you go if I change my clothes?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, if you are not too long. I never saw anybody take so long to\\ndress, and with such little result.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, at any rate, that is better than being always over-dressed as you\\nare.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIf I am occasionally a little over-dressed, I make up for it by being\\nalways immensely over-educated.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYour vanity is ridiculous, your conduct an outrage, and your presence\\nin my garden utterly absurd. However, you have got to catch the\\nfour-five, and I hope you will have a pleasant journey back to town.\\nThis Bunburying, as you call it, has not been a great success for you.\\n\\n[Goes into the house.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI think it has been a great success. I’m in love with Cecily, and that\\nis everything.\\n\\n[Enter Cecily at the back of the garden. She picks up the can and\\nbegins to water the flowers.] But I must see her before I go, and make\\narrangements for another Bunbury. Ah, there she is.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh, I merely came back to water the roses. I thought you were with\\nUncle Jack.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nHe’s gone to order the dog-cart for me.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh, is he going to take you for a nice drive?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nHe’s going to send me away.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nThen have we got to part?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI am afraid so. It’s a very painful parting.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nIt is always painful to part from people whom one has known for a very\\nbrief space of time. The absence of old friends one can endure with\\nequanimity. But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has\\njust been introduced is almost unbearable.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThank you.\\n\\n[Enter Merriman.]\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nThe dog-cart is at the door, sir. [Algernon looks appealingly at\\nCecily.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nIt can wait, Merriman for . . . five minutes.\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nYes, Miss. [Exit Merriman.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI hope, Cecily, I shall not offend you if I state quite frankly and\\nopenly that you seem to me to be in every way the visible\\npersonification of absolute perfection.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI think your frankness does you great credit, Ernest. If you will allow\\nme, I will copy your remarks into my diary. [Goes over to table and\\nbegins writing in diary.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nDo you really keep a diary? I’d give anything to look at it. May I?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh no. [Puts her hand over it.] You see, it is simply a very young\\ngirl’s record of her own thoughts and impressions, and consequently\\nmeant for publication. When it appears in volume form I hope you will\\norder a copy. But pray, Ernest, don’t stop. I delight in taking down\\nfrom dictation. I have reached ‘absolute perfection’. You can go on. I\\nam quite ready for more.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Somewhat taken aback.] Ahem! Ahem!\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh, don’t cough, Ernest. When one is dictating one should speak\\nfluently and not cough. Besides, I don’t know how to spell a cough.\\n[Writes as Algernon speaks.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Speaking very rapidly.] Cecily, ever since I first looked upon your\\nwonderful and incomparable beauty, I have dared to love you wildly,\\npassionately, devotedly, hopelessly.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI don’t think that you should tell me that you love me wildly,\\npassionately, devotedly, hopelessly. Hopelessly doesn’t seem to make\\nmuch sense, does it?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nCecily!\\n\\n[Enter Merriman.]\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nThe dog-cart is waiting, sir.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nTell it to come round next week, at the same hour.\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\n[Looks at Cecily, who makes no sign.] Yes, sir.\\n\\n[Merriman retires.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nUncle Jack would be very much annoyed if he knew you were staying on\\ntill next week, at the same hour.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOh, I don’t care about Jack. I don’t care for anybody in the whole\\nworld but you. I love you, Cecily. You will marry me, won’t you?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYou silly boy! Of course. Why, we have been engaged for the last three\\nmonths.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nFor the last three months?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYes, it will be exactly three months on Thursday.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBut how did we become engaged?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nWell, ever since dear Uncle Jack first confessed to us that he had a\\nyounger brother who was very wicked and bad, you of course have formed\\nthe chief topic of conversation between myself and Miss Prism. And of\\ncourse a man who is much talked about is always very attractive. One\\nfeels there must be something in him, after all. I daresay it was\\nfoolish of me, but I fell in love with you, Ernest.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nDarling! And when was the engagement actually settled?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOn the 14th of February last. Worn out by your entire ignorance of my\\nexistence, I determined to end the matter one way or the other, and\\nafter a long struggle with myself I accepted you under this dear old\\ntree here. The next day I bought this little ring in your name, and\\nthis is the little bangle with the true lover’s knot I promised you\\nalways to wear.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nDid I give you this? It’s very pretty, isn’t it?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYes, you’ve wonderfully good taste, Ernest. It’s the excuse I’ve always\\ngiven for your leading such a bad life. And this is the box in which I\\nkeep all your dear letters. [Kneels at table, opens box, and produces\\nletters tied up with blue ribbon.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nMy letters! But, my own sweet Cecily, I have never written you any\\nletters.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYou need hardly remind me of that, Ernest. I remember only too well\\nthat I was forced to write your letters for you. I wrote always three\\ntimes a week, and sometimes oftener.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOh, do let me read them, Cecily?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh, I couldn’t possibly. They would make you far too conceited.\\n[Replaces box.] The three you wrote me after I had broken off the\\nengagement are so beautiful, and so badly spelled, that even now I can\\nhardly read them without crying a little.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBut was our engagement ever broken off?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOf course it was. On the 22nd of last March. You can see the entry if\\nyou like. [Shows diary.] ‘To-day I broke off my engagement with Ernest.\\nI feel it is better to do so. The weather still continues charming.’\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBut why on earth did you break it off? What had I done? I had done\\nnothing at all. Cecily, I am very much hurt indeed to hear you broke it\\noff. Particularly when the weather was so charming.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nIt would hardly have been a really serious engagement if it hadn’t been\\nbroken off at least once. But I forgave you before the week was out.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Crossing to her, and kneeling.] What a perfect angel you are, Cecily.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYou dear romantic boy. [He kisses her, she puts her fingers through his\\nhair.] I hope your hair curls naturally, does it?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, darling, with a little help from others.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI am so glad.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYou’ll never break off our engagement again, Cecily?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI don’t think I could break it off now that I have actually met you.\\nBesides, of course, there is the question of your name.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, of course. [Nervously.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYou must not laugh at me, darling, but it had always been a girlish\\ndream of mine to love some one whose name was Ernest. [Algernon rises,\\nCecily also.] There is something in that name that seems to inspire\\nabsolute confidence. I pity any poor married woman whose husband is not\\ncalled Ernest.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBut, my dear child, do you mean to say you could not love me if I had\\nsome other name?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nBut what name?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOh, any name you like—Algernon—for instance . . .\\n\\nCECILY.\\nBut I don’t like the name of Algernon.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, my own dear, sweet, loving little darling, I really can’t see why\\nyou should object to the name of Algernon. It is not at all a bad name.\\nIn fact, it is rather an aristocratic name. Half of the chaps who get\\ninto the Bankruptcy Court are called Algernon. But seriously, Cecily .\\n. . [Moving to her] . . . if my name was Algy, couldn’t you love me?\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Rising.] I might respect you, Ernest, I might admire your character,\\nbut I fear that I should not be able to give you my undivided\\nattention.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nAhem! Cecily! [Picking up hat.] Your Rector here is, I suppose,\\nthoroughly experienced in the practice of all the rites and ceremonials\\nof the Church?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh, yes. Dr. Chasuble is a most learned man. He has never written a\\nsingle book, so you can imagine how much he knows.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI must see him at once on a most important christening—I mean on most\\nimportant business.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI shan’t be away more than half an hour.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nConsidering that we have been engaged since February the 14th, and that\\nI only met you to-day for the first time, I think it is rather hard\\nthat you should leave me for so long a period as half an hour. Couldn’t\\nyou make it twenty minutes?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI’ll be back in no time.\\n\\n[Kisses her and rushes down the garden.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nWhat an impetuous boy he is! I like his hair so much. I must enter his\\nproposal in my diary.\\n\\n[Enter Merriman.]\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nA Miss Fairfax has just called to see Mr. Worthing. On very important\\nbusiness, Miss Fairfax states.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nIsn’t Mr. Worthing in his library?\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nMr. Worthing went over in the direction of the Rectory some time ago.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nPray ask the lady to come out here; Mr. Worthing is sure to be back\\nsoon. And you can bring tea.\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nYes, Miss. [Goes out.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nMiss Fairfax! I suppose one of the many good elderly women who are\\nassociated with Uncle Jack in some of his philanthropic work in London.\\nI don’t quite like women who are interested in philanthropic work. I\\nthink it is so forward of them.\\n\\n[Enter Merriman.]\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nMiss Fairfax.\\n\\n[Enter Gwendolen.]\\n\\n[Exit Merriman.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Advancing to meet her.] Pray let me introduce myself to you. My name\\nis Cecily Cardew.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nCecily Cardew? [Moving to her and shaking hands.] What a very sweet\\nname! Something tells me that we are going to be great friends. I like\\nyou already more than I can say. My first impressions of people are\\nnever wrong.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nHow nice of you to like me so much after we have known each other such\\na comparatively short time. Pray sit down.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Still standing up.] I may call you Cecily, may I not?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nWith pleasure!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nAnd you will always call me Gwendolen, won’t you?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nIf you wish.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nThen that is all quite settled, is it not?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI hope so. [A pause. They both sit down together.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nPerhaps this might be a favourable opportunity for my mentioning who I\\nam. My father is Lord Bracknell. You have never heard of papa, I\\nsuppose?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI don’t think so.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nOutside the family circle, papa, I am glad to say, is entirely unknown.\\nI think that is quite as it should be. The home seems to me to be the\\nproper sphere for the man. And certainly once a man begins to neglect\\nhis domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate, does he not? And I\\ndon’t like that. It makes men so very attractive. Cecily, mamma, whose\\nviews on education are remarkably strict, has brought me up to be\\nextremely short-sighted; it is part of her system; so do you mind my\\nlooking at you through my glasses?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh! not at all, Gwendolen. I am very fond of being looked at.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[After examining Cecily carefully through a lorgnette.] You are here on\\na short visit, I suppose.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh no! I live here.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Severely.] Really? Your mother, no doubt, or some female relative of\\nadvanced years, resides here also?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh no! I have no mother, nor, in fact, any relations.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nIndeed?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nMy dear guardian, with the assistance of Miss Prism, has the arduous\\ntask of looking after me.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nYour guardian?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYes, I am Mr. Worthing’s ward.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nOh! It is strange he never mentioned to me that he had a ward. How\\nsecretive of him! He grows more interesting hourly. I am not sure,\\nhowever, that the news inspires me with feelings of unmixed delight.\\n[Rising and going to her.] I am very fond of you, Cecily; I have liked\\nyou ever since I met you! But I am bound to state that now that I know\\nthat you are Mr. Worthing’s ward, I cannot help expressing a wish you\\nwere—well, just a little older than you seem to be—and not quite so\\nvery alluring in appearance. In fact, if I may speak candidly—\\n\\nCECILY.\\nPray do! I think that whenever one has anything unpleasant to say, one\\nshould always be quite candid.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nWell, to speak with perfect candour, Cecily, I wish that you were fully\\nforty-two, and more than usually plain for your age. Ernest has a\\nstrong upright nature. He is the very soul of truth and honour.\\nDisloyalty would be as impossible to him as deception. But even men of\\nthe noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to the\\ninfluence of the physical charms of others. Modern, no less than\\nAncient History, supplies us with many most painful examples of what I\\nrefer to. If it were not so, indeed, History would be quite unreadable.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI beg your pardon, Gwendolen, did you say Ernest?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nYes.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh, but it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is my guardian. It is his\\nbrother—his elder brother.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Sitting down again.] Ernest never mentioned to me that he had a\\nbrother.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI am sorry to say they have not been on good terms for a long time.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nAh! that accounts for it. And now that I think of it I have never heard\\nany man mention his brother. The subject seems distasteful to most men.\\nCecily, you have lifted a load from my mind. I was growing almost\\nanxious. It would have been terrible if any cloud had come across a\\nfriendship like ours, would it not? Of course you are quite, quite sure\\nthat it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is your guardian?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nQuite sure. [A pause.] In fact, I am going to be his.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Inquiringly.] I beg your pardon?\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Rather shy and confidingly.] Dearest Gwendolen, there is no reason why\\nI should make a secret of it to you. Our little county newspaper is\\nsure to chronicle the fact next week. Mr. Ernest Worthing and I are\\nengaged to be married.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Quite politely, rising.] My darling Cecily, I think there must be some\\nslight error. Mr. Ernest Worthing is engaged to me. The announcement\\nwill appear in the _Morning Post_ on Saturday at the latest.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Very politely, rising.] I am afraid you must be under some\\nmisconception. Ernest proposed to me exactly ten minutes ago. [Shows\\ndiary.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Examines diary through her lorgnettte carefully.] It is certainly very\\ncurious, for he asked me to be his wife yesterday afternoon at 5.30. If\\nyou would care to verify the incident, pray do so. [Produces diary of\\nher own.] I never travel without my diary. One should always have\\nsomething sensational to read in the train. I am so sorry, dear Cecily,\\nif it is any disappointment to you, but I am afraid I have the prior\\nclaim.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nIt would distress me more than I can tell you, dear Gwendolen, if it\\ncaused you any mental or physical anguish, but I feel bound to point\\nout that since Ernest proposed to you he clearly has changed his mind.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Meditatively.] If the poor fellow has been entrapped into any foolish\\npromise I shall consider it my duty to rescue him at once, and with a\\nfirm hand.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Thoughtfully and sadly.] Whatever unfortunate entanglement my dear boy\\nmay have got into, I will never reproach him with it after we are\\nmarried.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nDo you allude to me, Miss Cardew, as an entanglement? You are\\npresumptuous. On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral\\nduty to speak one’s mind. It becomes a pleasure.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nDo you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that I entrapped Ernest into an\\nengagement? How dare you? This is no time for wearing the shallow mask\\nof manners. When I see a spade I call it a spade.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Satirically.] I am glad to say that I have never seen a spade. It is\\nobvious that our social spheres have been widely different.\\n\\n[Enter Merriman, followed by the footman. He carries a salver, table\\ncloth, and plate stand. Cecily is about to retort. The presence of the\\nservants exercises a restraining influence, under which both girls\\nchafe.]\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nShall I lay tea here as usual, Miss?\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Sternly, in a calm voice.] Yes, as usual. [Merriman begins to clear\\ntable and lay cloth. A long pause. Cecily and Gwendolen glare at each\\nother.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nAre there many interesting walks in the vicinity, Miss Cardew?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh! yes! a great many. From the top of one of the hills quite close one\\ncan see five counties.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nFive counties! I don’t think I should like that; I hate crowds.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Sweetly.] I suppose that is why you live in town? [Gwendolen bites her\\nlip, and beats her foot nervously with her parasol.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Looking round.] Quite a well-kept garden this is, Miss Cardew.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nSo glad you like it, Miss Fairfax.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI had no idea there were any flowers in the country.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh, flowers are as common here, Miss Fairfax, as people are in London.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nPersonally I cannot understand how anybody manages to exist in the\\ncountry, if anybody who is anybody does. The country always bores me to\\ndeath.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nAh! This is what the newspapers call agricultural depression, is it\\nnot? I believe the aristocracy are suffering very much from it just at\\npresent. It is almost an epidemic amongst them, I have been told. May I\\noffer you some tea, Miss Fairfax?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[With elaborate politeness.] Thank you. [Aside.] Detestable girl! But I\\nrequire tea!\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Sweetly.] Sugar?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Superciliously.] No, thank you. Sugar is not fashionable any more.\\n[Cecily looks angrily at her, takes up the tongs and puts four lumps of\\nsugar into the cup.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Severely.] Cake or bread and butter?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[In a bored manner.] Bread and butter, please. Cake is rarely seen at\\nthe best houses nowadays.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Cuts a very large slice of cake, and puts it on the tray.] Hand that\\nto Miss Fairfax.\\n\\n[Merriman does so, and goes out with footman. Gwendolen drinks the tea\\nand makes a grimace. Puts down cup at once, reaches out her hand to the\\nbread and butter, looks at it, and finds it is cake. Rises in\\nindignation.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nYou have filled my tea with lumps of sugar, and though I asked most\\ndistinctly for bread and butter, you have given me cake. I am known for\\nthe gentleness of my disposition, and the extraordinary sweetness of my\\nnature, but I warn you, Miss Cardew, you may go too far.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Rising.] To save my poor, innocent, trusting boy from the machinations\\nof any other girl there are no lengths to which I would not go.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nFrom the moment I saw you I distrusted you. I felt that you were false\\nand deceitful. I am never deceived in such matters. My first\\nimpressions of people are invariably right.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nIt seems to me, Miss Fairfax, that I am trespassing on your valuable\\ntime. No doubt you have many other calls of a similar character to make\\nin the neighbourhood.\\n\\n[Enter Jack.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Catching sight of him.] Ernest! My own Ernest!\\n\\nJACK.\\nGwendolen! Darling! [Offers to kiss her.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Draws back.] A moment! May I ask if you are engaged to be married to\\nthis young lady? [Points to Cecily.]\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Laughing.] To dear little Cecily! Of course not! What could have put\\nsuch an idea into your pretty little head?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nThank you. You may! [Offers her cheek.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Very sweetly.] I knew there must be some misunderstanding, Miss\\nFairfax. The gentleman whose arm is at present round your waist is my\\nguardian, Mr. John Worthing.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI beg your pardon?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nThis is Uncle Jack.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Receding.] Jack! Oh!\\n\\n[Enter Algernon.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nHere is Ernest.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Goes straight over to Cecily without noticing any one else.] My own\\nlove! [Offers to kiss her.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Drawing back.] A moment, Ernest! May I ask you—are you engaged to be\\nmarried to this young lady?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Looking round.] To what young lady? Good heavens! Gwendolen!\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYes! to good heavens, Gwendolen, I mean to Gwendolen.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Laughing.] Of course not! What could have put such an idea into your\\npretty little head?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nThank you. [Presenting her cheek to be kissed.] You may. [Algernon\\nkisses her.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI felt there was some slight error, Miss Cardew. The gentleman who is\\nnow embracing you is my cousin, Mr. Algernon Moncrieff.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Breaking away from Algernon.] Algernon Moncrieff! Oh! [The two girls\\nmove towards each other and put their arms round each other’s waists as\\nif for protection.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nAre you called Algernon?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI cannot deny it.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nOh!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nIs your name really John?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Standing rather proudly.] I could deny it if I liked. I could deny\\nanything if I liked. But my name certainly is John. It has been John\\nfor years.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[To Gwendolen.] A gross deception has been practised on both of us.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nMy poor wounded Cecily!\\n\\nCECILY.\\nMy sweet wronged Gwendolen!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Slowly and seriously.] You will call me sister, will you not? [They\\nembrace. Jack and Algernon groan and walk up and down.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Rather brightly.] There is just one question I would like to be\\nallowed to ask my guardian.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nAn admirable idea! Mr. Worthing, there is just one question I would\\nlike to be permitted to put to you. Where is your brother Ernest? We\\nare both engaged to be married to your brother Ernest, so it is a\\nmatter of some importance to us to know where your brother Ernest is at\\npresent.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Slowly and hesitatingly.] Gwendolen—Cecily—it is very painful for me\\nto be forced to speak the truth. It is the first time in my life that I\\nhave ever been reduced to such a painful position, and I am really\\nquite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind. However, I will tell\\nyou quite frankly that I have no brother Ernest. I have no brother at\\nall. I never had a brother in my life, and I certainly have not the\\nsmallest intention of ever having one in the future.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Surprised.] No brother at all?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Cheerily.] None!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[Severely.] Had you never a brother of any kind?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Pleasantly.] Never. Not even of any kind.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI am afraid it is quite clear, Cecily, that neither of us is engaged to\\nbe married to any one.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nIt is not a very pleasant position for a young girl suddenly to find\\nherself in. Is it?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nLet us go into the house. They will hardly venture to come after us\\nthere.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nNo, men are so cowardly, aren’t they?\\n\\n[They retire into the house with scornful looks.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nThis ghastly state of things is what you call Bunburying, I suppose?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, and a perfectly wonderful Bunbury it is. The most wonderful\\nBunbury I have ever had in my life.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, you’ve no right whatsoever to Bunbury here.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThat is absurd. One has a right to Bunbury anywhere one chooses. Every\\nserious Bunburyist knows that.\\n\\nJACK.\\nSerious Bunburyist! Good heavens!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, one must be serious about something, if one wants to have any\\namusement in life. I happen to be serious about Bunburying. What on\\nearth you are serious about I haven’t got the remotest idea. About\\neverything, I should fancy. You have such an absolutely trivial nature.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, the only small satisfaction I have in the whole of this wretched\\nbusiness is that your friend Bunbury is quite exploded. You won’t be\\nable to run down to the country quite so often as you used to do, dear\\nAlgy. And a very good thing too.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYour brother is a little off colour, isn’t he, dear Jack? You won’t be\\nable to disappear to London quite so frequently as your wicked custom\\nwas. And not a bad thing either.\\n\\nJACK.\\nAs for your conduct towards Miss Cardew, I must say that your taking in\\na sweet, simple, innocent girl like that is quite inexcusable. To say\\nnothing of the fact that she is my ward.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI can see no possible defence at all for your deceiving a brilliant,\\nclever, thoroughly experienced young lady like Miss Fairfax. To say\\nnothing of the fact that she is my cousin.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI wanted to be engaged to Gwendolen, that is all. I love her.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, I simply wanted to be engaged to Cecily. I adore her.\\n\\nJACK.\\nThere is certainly no chance of your marrying Miss Cardew.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI don’t think there is much likelihood, Jack, of you and Miss Fairfax\\nbeing united.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWell, that is no business of yours.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIf it was my business, I wouldn’t talk about it. [Begins to eat\\nmuffins.] It is very vulgar to talk about one’s business. Only people\\nlike stock-brokers do that, and then merely at dinner parties.\\n\\nJACK.\\nHow can you sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in this\\nhorrible trouble, I can’t make out. You seem to me to be perfectly\\nheartless.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, I can’t eat muffins in an agitated manner. The butter would\\nprobably get on my cuffs. One should always eat muffins quite calmly.\\nIt is the only way to eat them.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI say it’s perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all, under the\\ncircumstances.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWhen I am in trouble, eating is the only thing that consoles me.\\nIndeed, when I am in really great trouble, as any one who knows me\\nintimately will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink. At\\nthe present moment I am eating muffins because I am unhappy. Besides, I\\nam particularly fond of muffins. [Rising.]\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Rising.] Well, that is no reason why you should eat them all in that\\ngreedy way. [Takes muffins from Algernon.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Offering tea-cake.] I wish you would have tea-cake instead. I don’t\\nlike tea-cake.\\n\\nJACK.\\nGood heavens! I suppose a man may eat his own muffins in his own\\ngarden.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBut you have just said it was perfectly heartless to eat muffins.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI said it was perfectly heartless of you, under the circumstances. That\\nis a very different thing.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThat may be. But the muffins are the same. [He seizes the muffin-dish\\nfrom Jack.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nAlgy, I wish to goodness you would go.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYou can’t possibly ask me to go without having some dinner. It’s\\nabsurd. I never go without my dinner. No one ever does, except\\nvegetarians and people like that. Besides I have just made arrangements\\nwith Dr. Chasuble to be christened at a quarter to six under the name\\nof Ernest.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMy dear fellow, the sooner you give up that nonsense the better. I made\\narrangements this morning with Dr. Chasuble to be christened myself at\\n5.30, and I naturally will take the name of Ernest. Gwendolen would\\nwish it. We can’t both be christened Ernest. It’s absurd. Besides, I\\nhave a perfect right to be christened if I like. There is no evidence\\nat all that I have ever been christened by anybody. I should think it\\nextremely probable I never was, and so does Dr. Chasuble. It is\\nentirely different in your case. You have been christened already.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, but I have not been christened for years.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYes, but you have been christened. That is the important thing.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nQuite so. So I know my constitution can stand it. If you are not quite\\nsure about your ever having been christened, I must say I think it\\nrather dangerous your venturing on it now. It might make you very\\nunwell. You can hardly have forgotten that some one very closely\\nconnected with you was very nearly carried off this week in Paris by a\\nsevere chill.\\n\\nJACK.\\nYes, but you said yourself that a severe chill was not hereditary.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIt usen’t to be, I know—but I daresay it is now. Science is always\\nmaking wonderful improvements in things.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Picking up the muffin-dish.] Oh, that is nonsense; you are always\\ntalking nonsense.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nJack, you are at the muffins again! I wish you wouldn’t. There are only\\ntwo left. [Takes them.] I told you I was particularly fond of muffins.\\n\\nJACK.\\nBut I hate tea-cake.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWhy on earth then do you allow tea-cake to be served up for your\\nguests? What ideas you have of hospitality!\\n\\nJACK.\\nAlgernon! I have already told you to go. I don’t want you here. Why\\ndon’t you go!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI haven’t quite finished my tea yet! and there is still one muffin\\nleft. [Jack groans, and sinks into a chair. Algernon still continues\\neating.]\\n\\nACT DROP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHIRD ACT\\n\\nSCENE\\n\\nMorning-room at the Manor House.\\n\\n[Gwendolen and Cecily are at the window, looking out into the garden.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nThe fact that they did not follow us at once into the house, as any one\\nelse would have done, seems to me to show that they have some sense of\\nshame left.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nThey have been eating muffins. That looks like repentance.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[After a pause.] They don’t seem to notice us at all. Couldn’t you\\ncough?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nBut I haven’t got a cough.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nThey’re looking at us. What effrontery!\\n\\nCECILY.\\nThey’re approaching. That’s very forward of them.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nLet us preserve a dignified silence.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nCertainly. It’s the only thing to do now. [Enter Jack followed by\\nAlgernon. They whistle some dreadful popular air from a British Opera.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nThis dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nA most distasteful one.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nBut we will not be the first to speak.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nMr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you. Much depends\\non your reply.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nGwendolen, your common sense is invaluable. Mr. Moncrieff, kindly\\nanswer me the following question. Why did you pretend to be my\\nguardian’s brother?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nIn order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[To Gwendolen.] That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does\\nit not?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nYes, dear, if you can believe him.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI don’t. But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his answer.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nTrue. In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital\\nthing. Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me for\\npretending to have a brother? Was it in order that you might have an\\nopportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?\\n\\nJACK.\\nCan you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI have the gravest doubts upon the subject. But I intend to crush them.\\nThis is not the moment for German scepticism. [Moving to Cecily.] Their\\nexplanations appear to be quite satisfactory, especially Mr.\\nWorthing’s. That seems to me to have the stamp of truth upon it.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said. His voice alone\\ninspires one with absolute credulity.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nThen you think we should forgive them?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYes. I mean no.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nTrue! I had forgotten. There are principles at stake that one cannot\\nsurrender. Which of us should tell them? The task is not a pleasant\\none.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nCould we not both speak at the same time?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nAn excellent idea! I nearly always speak at the same time as other\\npeople. Will you take the time from me?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nCertainly. [Gwendolen beats time with uplifted finger.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN and CECILY [Speaking together.] Your Christian names are\\nstill an insuperable barrier. That is all!\\n\\nJACK and ALGERNON [Speaking together.] Our Christian names! Is that\\nall? But we are going to be christened this afternoon.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[To Jack.] For my sake you are prepared to do this terrible thing?\\n\\nJACK.\\nI am.\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[To Algernon.] To please me you are ready to face this fearful ordeal?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI am!\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nHow absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes! Where questions of\\nself-sacrifice are concerned, men are infinitely beyond us.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWe are. [Clasps hands with Algernon.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nThey have moments of physical courage of which we women know absolutely\\nnothing.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[To Jack.] Darling!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[To Cecily.] Darling! [They fall into each other’s arms.]\\n\\n[Enter Merriman. When he enters he coughs loudly, seeing the\\nsituation.]\\n\\nMERRIMAN.\\nAhem! Ahem! Lady Bracknell!\\n\\nJACK.\\nGood heavens!\\n\\n[Enter Lady Bracknell. The couples separate in alarm. Exit Merriman.]\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nGwendolen! What does this mean?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nMerely that I am engaged to be married to Mr. Worthing, mamma.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nCome here. Sit down. Sit down immediately. Hesitation of any kind is a\\nsign of mental decay in the young, of physical weakness in the old.\\n[Turns to Jack.] Apprised, sir, of my daughter’s sudden flight by her\\ntrusty maid, whose confidence I purchased by means of a small coin, I\\nfollowed her at once by a luggage train. Her unhappy father is, I am\\nglad to say, under the impression that she is attending a more than\\nusually lengthy lecture by the University Extension Scheme on the\\nInfluence of a permanent income on Thought. I do not propose to\\nundeceive him. Indeed I have never undeceived him on any question. I\\nwould consider it wrong. But of course, you will clearly understand\\nthat all communication between yourself and my daughter must cease\\nimmediately from this moment. On this point, as indeed on all points, I\\nam firm.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI am engaged to be married to Gwendolen, Lady Bracknell!\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nYou are nothing of the kind, sir. And now, as regards Algernon! . . .\\nAlgernon!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, Aunt Augusta.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nMay I ask if it is in this house that your invalid friend Mr. Bunbury\\nresides?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Stammering.] Oh! No! Bunbury doesn’t live here. Bunbury is somewhere\\nelse at present. In fact, Bunbury is dead.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nDead! When did Mr. Bunbury die? His death must have been extremely\\nsudden.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\n[Airily.] Oh! I killed Bunbury this afternoon. I mean poor Bunbury died\\nthis afternoon.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nWhat did he die of?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nBunbury? Oh, he was quite exploded.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nExploded! Was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage? I was not aware\\nthat Mr. Bunbury was interested in social legislation. If so, he is\\nwell punished for his morbidity.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nMy dear Aunt Augusta, I mean he was found out! The doctors found out\\nthat Bunbury could not live, that is what I mean—so Bunbury died.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nHe seems to have had great confidence in the opinion of his physicians.\\nI am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the last to some\\ndefinite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice. And\\nnow that we have finally got rid of this Mr. Bunbury, may I ask, Mr.\\nWorthing, who is that young person whose hand my nephew Algernon is now\\nholding in what seems to me a peculiarly unnecessary manner?\\n\\nJACK.\\nThat lady is Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward. [Lady Bracknell bows coldly\\nto Cecily.]\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nI am engaged to be married to Cecily, Aunt Augusta.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nI beg your pardon?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nMr. Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[With a shiver, crossing to the sofa and sitting down.] I do not know\\nwhether there is anything peculiarly exciting in the air of this\\nparticular part of Hertfordshire, but the number of engagements that go\\non seems to me considerably above the proper average that statistics\\nhave laid down for our guidance. I think some preliminary inquiry on my\\npart would not be out of place. Mr. Worthing, is Miss Cardew at all\\nconnected with any of the larger railway stations in London? I merely\\ndesire information. Until yesterday I had no idea that there were any\\nfamilies or persons whose origin was a Terminus. [Jack looks perfectly\\nfurious, but restrains himself.]\\n\\nJACK.\\n[In a clear, cold voice.] Miss Cardew is the grand-daughter of the late\\nMr. Thomas Cardew of 149 Belgrave Square, S.W.; Gervase Park, Dorking,\\nSurrey; and the Sporran, Fifeshire, N.B.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThat sounds not unsatisfactory. Three addresses always inspire\\nconfidence, even in tradesmen. But what proof have I of their\\nauthenticity?\\n\\nJACK.\\nI have carefully preserved the Court Guides of the period. They are\\nopen to your inspection, Lady Bracknell.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Grimly.] I have known strange errors in that publication.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMiss Cardew’s family solicitors are Messrs. Markby, Markby, and Markby.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nMarkby, Markby, and Markby? A firm of the very highest position in\\ntheir profession. Indeed I am told that one of the Mr. Markby’s is\\noccasionally to be seen at dinner parties. So far I am satisfied.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Very irritably.] How extremely kind of you, Lady Bracknell! I have\\nalso in my possession, you will be pleased to hear, certificates of\\nMiss Cardew’s birth, baptism, whooping cough, registration,\\nvaccination, confirmation, and the measles; both the German and the\\nEnglish variety.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nAh! A life crowded with incident, I see; though perhaps somewhat too\\nexciting for a young girl. I am not myself in favour of premature\\nexperiences. [Rises, looks at her watch.] Gwendolen! the time\\napproaches for our departure. We have not a moment to lose. As a matter\\nof form, Mr. Worthing, I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any\\nlittle fortune?\\n\\nJACK.\\nOh! about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the Funds. That is\\nall. Goodbye, Lady Bracknell. So pleased to have seen you.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Sitting down again.] A moment, Mr. Worthing. A hundred and thirty\\nthousand pounds! And in the Funds! Miss Cardew seems to me a most\\nattractive young lady, now that I look at her. Few girls of the present\\nday have any really solid qualities, any of the qualities that last,\\nand improve with time. We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces.\\n[To Cecily.] Come over here, dear. [Cecily goes across.] Pretty child!\\nyour dress is sadly simple, and your hair seems almost as Nature might\\nhave left it. But we can soon alter all that. A thoroughly experienced\\nFrench maid produces a really marvellous result in a very brief space\\nof time. I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing, and after\\nthree months her own husband did not know her.\\n\\nJACK.\\nAnd after six months nobody knew her.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Glares at Jack for a few moments. Then bends, with a practised smile,\\nto Cecily.] Kindly turn round, sweet child. [Cecily turns completely\\nround.] No, the side view is what I want. [Cecily presents her\\nprofile.] Yes, quite as I expected. There are distinct social\\npossibilities in your profile. The two weak points in our age are its\\nwant of principle and its want of profile. The chin a little higher,\\ndear. Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn. They are worn\\nvery high, just at present. Algernon!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nYes, Aunt Augusta!\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThere are distinct social possibilities in Miss Cardew’s profile.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nCecily is the sweetest, dearest, prettiest girl in the whole world. And\\nI don’t care twopence about social possibilities.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nNever speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon. Only people who can’t\\nget into it do that. [To Cecily.] Dear child, of course you know that\\nAlgernon has nothing but his debts to depend upon. But I do not approve\\nof mercenary marriages. When I married Lord Bracknell I had no fortune\\nof any kind. But I never dreamed for a moment of allowing that to stand\\nin my way. Well, I suppose I must give my consent.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThank you, Aunt Augusta.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nCecily, you may kiss me!\\n\\nCECILY.\\n[Kisses her.] Thank you, Lady Bracknell.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nYou may also address me as Aunt Augusta for the future.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nThank you, Aunt Augusta.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThe marriage, I think, had better take place quite soon.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThank you, Aunt Augusta.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nThank you, Aunt Augusta.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nTo speak frankly, I am not in favour of long engagements. They give\\npeople the opportunity of finding out each other’s character before\\nmarriage, which I think is never advisable.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI beg your pardon for interrupting you, Lady Bracknell, but this\\nengagement is quite out of the question. I am Miss Cardew’s guardian,\\nand she cannot marry without my consent until she comes of age. That\\nconsent I absolutely decline to give.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nUpon what grounds may I ask? Algernon is an extremely, I may almost say\\nan ostentatiously, eligible young man. He has nothing, but he looks\\neverything. What more can one desire?\\n\\nJACK.\\nIt pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you, Lady Bracknell,\\nabout your nephew, but the fact is that I do not approve at all of his\\nmoral character. I suspect him of being untruthful. [Algernon and\\nCecily look at him in indignant amazement.]\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nUntruthful! My nephew Algernon? Impossible! He is an Oxonian.\\n\\nJACK.\\nI fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter. This afternoon\\nduring my temporary absence in London on an important question of\\nromance, he obtained admission to my house by means of the false\\npretence of being my brother. Under an assumed name he drank, I’ve just\\nbeen informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet,\\nBrut, ’89; wine I was specially reserving for myself. Continuing his\\ndisgraceful deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in\\nalienating the affections of my only ward. He subsequently stayed to\\ntea, and devoured every single muffin. And what makes his conduct all\\nthe more heartless is, that he was perfectly well aware from the first\\nthat I have no brother, that I never had a brother, and that I don’t\\nintend to have a brother, not even of any kind. I distinctly told him\\nso myself yesterday afternoon.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nAhem! Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration I have decided entirely\\nto overlook my nephew’s conduct to you.\\n\\nJACK.\\nThat is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell. My own decision, however,\\nis unalterable. I decline to give my consent.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[To Cecily.] Come here, sweet child. [Cecily goes over.] How old are\\nyou, dear?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nWell, I am really only eighteen, but I always admit to twenty when I go\\nto evening parties.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nYou are perfectly right in making some slight alteration. Indeed, no\\nwoman should ever be quite accurate about her age. It looks so\\ncalculating . . . [In a meditative manner.] Eighteen, but admitting to\\ntwenty at evening parties. Well, it will not be very long before you\\nare of age and free from the restraints of tutelage. So I don’t think\\nyour guardian’s consent is, after all, a matter of any importance.\\n\\nJACK.\\nPray excuse me, Lady Bracknell, for interrupting you again, but it is\\nonly fair to tell you that according to the terms of her grandfather’s\\nwill Miss Cardew does not come legally of age till she is thirty-five.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThat does not seem to me to be a grave objection. Thirty-five is a very\\nattractive age. London society is full of women of the very highest\\nbirth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty-five for\\nyears. Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point. To my own knowledge she\\nhas been thirty-five ever since she arrived at the age of forty, which\\nwas many years ago now. I see no reason why our dear Cecily should not\\nbe even still more attractive at the age you mention than she is at\\npresent. There will be a large accumulation of property.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nAlgy, could you wait for me till I was thirty-five?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nOf course I could, Cecily. You know I could.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nYes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn’t wait all that time. I hate\\nwaiting even five minutes for anybody. It always makes me rather cross.\\nI am not punctual myself, I know, but I do like punctuality in others,\\nand waiting, even to be married, is quite out of the question.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nThen what is to be done, Cecily?\\n\\nCECILY.\\nI don’t know, Mr. Moncrieff.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nMy dear Mr. Worthing, as Miss Cardew states positively that she cannot\\nwait till she is thirty-five—a remark which I am bound to say seems to\\nme to show a somewhat impatient nature—I would beg of you to reconsider\\nyour decision.\\n\\nJACK.\\nBut my dear Lady Bracknell, the matter is entirely in your own hands.\\nThe moment you consent to my marriage with Gwendolen, I will most\\ngladly allow your nephew to form an alliance with my ward.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Rising and drawing herself up.] You must be quite aware that what you\\npropose is out of the question.\\n\\nJACK.\\nThen a passionate celibacy is all that any of us can look forward to.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThat is not the destiny I propose for Gwendolen. Algernon, of course,\\ncan choose for himself. [Pulls out her watch.] Come, dear, [Gwendolen\\nrises] we have already missed five, if not six, trains. To miss any\\nmore might expose us to comment on the platform.\\n\\n[Enter Dr. Chasuble.]\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nEverything is quite ready for the christenings.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThe christenings, sir! Is not that somewhat premature?\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\n[Looking rather puzzled, and pointing to Jack and Algernon.] Both these\\ngentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate baptism.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nAt their age? The idea is grotesque and irreligious! Algernon, I forbid\\nyou to be baptized. I will not hear of such excesses. Lord Bracknell\\nwould be highly displeased if he learned that that was the way in which\\nyou wasted your time and money.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nAm I to understand then that there are to be no christenings at all\\nthis afternoon?\\n\\nJACK.\\nI don’t think that, as things are now, it would be of much practical\\nvalue to either of us, Dr. Chasuble.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nI am grieved to hear such sentiments from you, Mr. Worthing. They\\nsavour of the heretical views of the Anabaptists, views that I have\\ncompletely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons. However, as your\\npresent mood seems to be one peculiarly secular, I will return to the\\nchurch at once. Indeed, I have just been informed by the pew-opener\\nthat for the last hour and a half Miss Prism has been waiting for me in\\nthe vestry.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Starting.] Miss Prism! Did I hear you mention a Miss Prism?\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nYes, Lady Bracknell. I am on my way to join her.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nPray allow me to detain you for a moment. This matter may prove to be\\none of vital importance to Lord Bracknell and myself. Is this Miss\\nPrism a female of repellent aspect, remotely connected with education?\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\n[Somewhat indignantly.] She is the most cultivated of ladies, and the\\nvery picture of respectability.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nIt is obviously the same person. May I ask what position she holds in\\nyour household?\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\n[Severely.] I am a celibate, madam.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Interposing.] Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, has been for the last three\\nyears Miss Cardew’s esteemed governess and valued companion.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nIn spite of what I hear of her, I must see her at once. Let her be sent\\nfor.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\n[Looking off.] She approaches; she is nigh.\\n\\n[Enter Miss Prism hurriedly.]\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nI was told you expected me in the vestry, dear Canon. I have been\\nwaiting for you there for an hour and three-quarters. [Catches sight of\\nLady Bracknell, who has fixed her with a stony glare. Miss Prism grows\\npale and quails. She looks anxiously round as if desirous to escape.]\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[In a severe, judicial voice.] Prism! [Miss Prism bows her head in\\nshame.] Come here, Prism! [Miss Prism approaches in a humble manner.]\\nPrism! Where is that baby? [General consternation. The Canon starts\\nback in horror. Algernon and Jack pretend to be anxious to shield\\nCecily and Gwendolen from hearing the details of a terrible public\\nscandal.] Twenty-eight years ago, Prism, you left Lord Bracknell’s\\nhouse, Number 104, Upper Grosvenor Street, in charge of a perambulator\\nthat contained a baby of the male sex. You never returned. A few weeks\\nlater, through the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan police,\\nthe perambulator was discovered at midnight, standing by itself in a\\nremote corner of Bayswater. It contained the manuscript of a\\nthree-volume novel of more than usually revolting sentimentality. [Miss\\nPrism starts in involuntary indignation.] But the baby was not there!\\n[Every one looks at Miss Prism.] Prism! Where is that baby? [A pause.]\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nLady Bracknell, I admit with shame that I do not know. I only wish I\\ndid. The plain facts of the case are these. On the morning of the day\\nyou mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory, I prepared as\\nusual to take the baby out in its perambulator. I had also with me a\\nsomewhat old, but capacious hand-bag in which I had intended to place\\nthe manuscript of a work of fiction that I had written during my few\\nunoccupied hours. In a moment of mental abstraction, for which I never\\ncan forgive myself, I deposited the manuscript in the basinette, and\\nplaced the baby in the hand-bag.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Who has been listening attentively.] But where did you deposit the\\nhand-bag?\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nDo not ask me, Mr. Worthing.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMiss Prism, this is a matter of no small importance to me. I insist on\\nknowing where you deposited the hand-bag that contained that infant.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\nI left it in the cloak-room of one of the larger railway stations in\\nLondon.\\n\\nJACK.\\nWhat railway station?\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Quite crushed.] Victoria. The Brighton line. [Sinks into a chair.]\\n\\nJACK.\\nI must retire to my room for a moment. Gwendolen, wait here for me.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nIf you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life. [Exit\\nJack in great excitement.]\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nWhat do you think this means, Lady Bracknell?\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nI dare not even suspect, Dr. Chasuble. I need hardly tell you that in\\nfamilies of high position strange coincidences are not supposed to\\noccur. They are hardly considered the thing.\\n\\n[Noises heard overhead as if some one was throwing trunks about. Every\\none looks up.]\\n\\nCECILY.\\nUncle Jack seems strangely agitated.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\nYour guardian has a very emotional nature.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThis noise is extremely unpleasant. It sounds as if he was having an\\nargument. I dislike arguments of any kind. They are always vulgar, and\\noften convincing.\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\n[Looking up.] It has stopped now. [The noise is redoubled.]\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nI wish he would arrive at some conclusion.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nThis suspense is terrible. I hope it will last. [Enter Jack with a\\nhand-bag of black leather in his hand.]\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Rushing over to Miss Prism.] Is this the hand-bag, Miss Prism? Examine\\nit carefully before you speak. The happiness of more than one life\\ndepends on your answer.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Calmly.] It seems to be mine. Yes, here is the injury it received\\nthrough the upsetting of a Gower Street omnibus in younger and happier\\ndays. Here is the stain on the lining caused by the explosion of a\\ntemperance beverage, an incident that occurred at Leamington. And here,\\non the lock, are my initials. I had forgotten that in an extravagant\\nmood I had had them placed there. The bag is undoubtedly mine. I am\\ndelighted to have it so unexpectedly restored to me. It has been a\\ngreat inconvenience being without it all these years.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[In a pathetic voice.] Miss Prism, more is restored to you than this\\nhand-bag. I was the baby you placed in it.\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Amazed.] You?\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Embracing her.] Yes . . . mother!\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Recoiling in indignant astonishment.] Mr. Worthing! I am unmarried!\\n\\nJACK.\\nUnmarried! I do not deny that is a serious blow. But after all, who has\\nthe right to cast a stone against one who has suffered? Cannot\\nrepentance wipe out an act of folly? Why should there be one law for\\nmen, and another for women? Mother, I forgive you. [Tries to embrace\\nher again.]\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Still more indignant.] Mr. Worthing, there is some error. [Pointing to\\nLady Bracknell.] There is the lady who can tell you who you really are.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[After a pause.] Lady Bracknell, I hate to seem inquisitive, but would\\nyou kindly inform me who I am?\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nI am afraid that the news I have to give you will not altogether please\\nyou. You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs. Moncrieff, and\\nconsequently Algernon’s elder brother.\\n\\nJACK.\\nAlgy’s elder brother! Then I have a brother after all. I knew I had a\\nbrother! I always said I had a brother! Cecily,—how could you have ever\\ndoubted that I had a brother? [Seizes hold of Algernon.] Dr. Chasuble,\\nmy unfortunate brother. Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother. Gwendolen,\\nmy unfortunate brother. Algy, you young scoundrel, you will have to\\ntreat me with more respect in the future. You have never behaved to me\\nlike a brother in all your life.\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nWell, not till to-day, old boy, I admit. I did my best, however, though\\nI was out of practice.\\n\\n[Shakes hands.]\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\n[To Jack.] My own! But what own are you? What is your Christian name,\\nnow that you have become some one else?\\n\\nJACK.\\nGood heavens! . . . I had quite forgotten that point. Your decision on\\nthe subject of my name is irrevocable, I suppose?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI never change, except in my affections.\\n\\nCECILY.\\nWhat a noble nature you have, Gwendolen!\\n\\nJACK.\\nThen the question had better be cleared up at once. Aunt Augusta, a\\nmoment. At the time when Miss Prism left me in the hand-bag, had I been\\nchristened already?\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nEvery luxury that money could buy, including christening, had been\\nlavished on you by your fond and doting parents.\\n\\nJACK.\\nThen I was christened! That is settled. Now, what name was I given? Let\\nme know the worst.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nBeing the eldest son you were naturally christened after your father.\\n\\nJACK.\\n[Irritably.] Yes, but what was my father’s Christian name?\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\n[Meditatively.] I cannot at the present moment recall what the\\nGeneral’s Christian name was. But I have no doubt he had one. He was\\neccentric, I admit. But only in later years. And that was the result of\\nthe Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion, and other things of\\nthat kind.\\n\\nJACK.\\nAlgy! Can’t you recollect what our father’s Christian name was?\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nMy dear boy, we were never even on speaking terms. He died before I was\\na year old.\\n\\nJACK.\\nHis name would appear in the Army Lists of the period, I suppose, Aunt\\nAugusta?\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nThe General was essentially a man of peace, except in his domestic\\nlife. But I have no doubt his name would appear in any military\\ndirectory.\\n\\nJACK.\\nThe Army Lists of the last forty years are here. These delightful\\nrecords should have been my constant study. [Rushes to bookcase and\\ntears the books out.] M. Generals . . . Mallam, Maxbohm, Magley, what\\nghastly names they have—Markby, Migsby, Mobbs, Moncrieff! Lieutenant\\n1840, Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel, Colonel, General 1869, Christian\\nnames, Ernest John. [Puts book very quietly down and speaks quite\\ncalmly.] I always told you, Gwendolen, my name was Ernest, didn’t I?\\nWell, it is Ernest after all. I mean it naturally is Ernest.\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nYes, I remember now that the General was called Ernest, I knew I had\\nsome particular reason for disliking the name.\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nErnest! My own Ernest! I felt from the first that you could have no\\nother name!\\n\\nJACK.\\nGwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that\\nall his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth. Can you\\nforgive me?\\n\\nGWENDOLEN.\\nI can. For I feel that you are sure to change.\\n\\nJACK.\\nMy own one!\\n\\nCHASUBLE.\\n[To Miss Prism.] Lætitia! [Embraces her]\\n\\nMISS PRISM.\\n[Enthusiastically.] Frederick! At last!\\n\\nALGERNON.\\nCecily! [Embraces her.] At last!\\n\\nJACK.\\nGwendolen! [Embraces her.] At last!\\n\\nLADY BRACKNELL.\\nMy nephew, you seem to be displaying signs of triviality.\\n\\nJACK.\\nOn the contrary, Aunt Augusta, I’ve now realised for the first time in\\nmy life the vital Importance of Being Earnest.\\n\\nTABLEAU\\n I\\n\\n\\nOne morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found\\nhimself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his\\narmour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his\\nbrown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.\\nThe bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off\\nany moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the\\nrest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.\\n\\n“What’s happened to me?” he thought. It wasn’t a dream. His room, a\\nproper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between\\nits four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out\\non the table—Samsa was a travelling salesman—and above it there hung a\\npicture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and\\nhoused in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur\\nhat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered\\nthe whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.\\n\\nGregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of\\nrain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.\\n“How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this\\nnonsense”, he thought, but that was something he was unable to do\\nbecause he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state\\ncouldn’t get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his\\nright, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a\\nhundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn’t have to look at the\\nfloundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull\\npain there that he had never felt before.\\n\\n“Oh, God”, he thought, “what a strenuous career it is that I’ve chosen!\\nTravelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more\\neffort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there’s\\nthe curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad\\nand irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that\\nyou can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can\\nall go to Hell!” He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself\\nslowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his\\nhead better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with\\nlots of little white spots which he didn’t know what to make of; and\\nwhen he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly\\nback because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold\\nshudder.\\n\\nHe slid back into his former position. “Getting up early all the time”,\\nhe thought, “it makes you stupid. You’ve got to get enough sleep. Other\\ntravelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go\\nback to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract,\\nthese gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts.\\nI ought to just try that with my boss; I’d get kicked out on the spot.\\nBut who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn’t\\nhave my parents to think about I’d have given in my notice a long time\\nago, I’d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell\\nhim everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He’d fall right\\noff his desk! And it’s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there\\nat your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,\\nespecially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard\\nof hearing. Well, there’s still some hope; once I’ve got the money\\ntogether to pay off my parents’ debt to him—another five or six years I\\nsuppose—that’s definitely what I’ll do. That’s when I’ll make the big\\nchange. First of all though, I’ve got to get up, my train leaves at\\nfive.”\\n\\nAnd he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.\\n“God in Heaven!” he thought. It was half past six and the hands were\\nquietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like\\nquarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the\\nbed that it had been set for four o’clock as it should have been; it\\ncertainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep\\nthrough that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept\\npeacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What\\nshould he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch\\nthat he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was\\nstill not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and\\nlively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his\\nboss’s anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the\\nfive o’clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor’s\\nnot being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss’s\\nman, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported\\nsick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in five\\nyears of service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would\\ncertainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance\\ncompany, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the\\ndoctor’s recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed\\nthat no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what’s more,\\nwould he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact,\\napart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel\\ncompletely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.\\n\\nHe was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to\\nget out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a\\ncautious knock at the door near his head. “Gregor”, somebody called—it\\nwas his mother—“it’s quarter to seven. Didn’t you want to go\\nsomewhere?” That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his own\\nvoice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had\\nbefore. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and\\nuncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out\\nat first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear,\\nleaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not. Gregor\\nhad wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the\\ncircumstances contented himself with saying: “Yes, mother, yes,\\nthank-you, I’m getting up now.” The change in Gregor’s voice probably\\ncould not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother was\\nsatisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. But this short\\nconversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor,\\nagainst their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came\\nknocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. “Gregor,\\nGregor”, he called, “what’s wrong?” And after a short while he called\\nagain with a warning deepness in his voice: “Gregor! Gregor!” At the\\nother side door his sister came plaintively: “Gregor? Aren’t you well?\\nDo you need anything?” Gregor answered to both sides: “I’m ready, now”,\\nmaking an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by\\nenunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each,\\nindividual word. His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister\\nwhispered: “Gregor, open the door, I beg of you.” Gregor, however, had\\nno thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for\\nhis cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors\\nat night even when he was at home.\\n\\nThe first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being\\ndisturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only\\nthen would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he\\nwould not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in\\nbed. He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps\\ncaused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure\\nimagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve\\nthemselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt that the change\\nin his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold,\\nwhich was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.\\n\\nIt was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow\\nhimself up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became\\ndifficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He\\nwould have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead\\nof them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in\\ndifferent directions, and which he was moreover unable to control. If\\nhe wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would\\nstretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with\\nthat leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about\\npainfully. “This is something that can’t be done in bed”, Gregor said\\nto himself, “so don’t keep trying to do it”.\\n\\nThe first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out\\nof the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not\\nimagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it\\nwent so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly\\nshoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose\\nthe wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned\\nfrom the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might\\nwell, at present, be the most sensitive.\\n\\nSo then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first,\\ncarefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily,\\nand despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually\\nfollowed slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last\\ngot his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him\\nthat if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not\\ninjured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the\\nsame way. And he could not knock himself out now at any price; better\\nto stay in bed than lose consciousness.\\n\\nIt took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier,\\nbut when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as\\nthey struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was\\npossible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this\\nchaos. He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to\\nstay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free\\nof it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice. At the same time,\\nthough, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was\\nmuch better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At times like this\\nhe would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he\\ncould, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was\\nenveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to\\noffer him. “Seven o’clock, already”, he said to himself when the clock\\nstruck again, “seven o’clock, and there’s still a fog like this.” And\\nhe lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps\\nexpected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and\\nnatural state.\\n\\nBut then he said to himself: “Before it strikes quarter past seven I’ll\\ndefinitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody\\nwill have come round from work to ask what’s happened to me as well, as\\nthey open up at work before seven o’clock.” And so he set himself to\\nthe task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all\\nat the same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and\\nkept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it.\\nHis back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to\\nit falling onto the carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise he\\nwas bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably\\nraise concern if not alarm. But it was something that had to be risked.\\n\\nWhen Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed—the new method\\nwas more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and\\nforth—it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody\\ncame to help him. Two strong people—he had his father and the maid in\\nmind—would have been more than enough; they would only have to push\\ntheir arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend\\ndown with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over\\nonto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use.\\nShould he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that\\nall the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he\\ncould not suppress a smile at this thought.\\n\\nAfter a while he had already moved so far across that it would have\\nbeen hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time\\nwas now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very\\nsoon. Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. “That’ll be\\nsomeone from work”, he said to himself, and froze very still, although\\nhis little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around.\\nFor a moment everything remained quiet. “They’re not opening the door”,\\nGregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of\\ncourse, the maid’s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it.\\nGregor only needed to hear the visitor’s first words of greeting and he\\nknew who it was—the chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the\\nonly one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became\\nhighly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees,\\nevery one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful\\nand devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he\\ncouldn’t get out of bed if he didn’t spend at least a couple of hours\\nin the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let one\\nof the trainees make enquiries—assuming enquiries were even\\nnecessary—did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have\\nto show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that\\nonly the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate\\nit? And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any\\nproper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed.\\nThere was a loud thump, but it wasn’t really a loud noise. His fall was\\nsoftened a little by the carpet, and Gregor’s back was also more\\nelastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too\\nnoticeable. He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit\\nit as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against\\nthe carpet.\\n\\n“Something’s fallen down in there”, said the chief clerk in the room on\\nthe left. Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that\\nhad happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you\\nhad to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this\\nquestion, the chief clerk’s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots\\ncould now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right,\\nGregor’s sister whispered to him to let him know: “Gregor, the chief\\nclerk is here.” “Yes, I know”, said Gregor to himself; but without\\ndaring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.\\n\\n“Gregor”, said his father now from the room to his left, “the chief\\nclerk has come round and wants to know why you didn’t leave on the\\nearly train. We don’t know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants to\\nspeak to you personally. So please open up this door. I’m sure he’ll be\\ngood enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.” Then the chief\\nclerk called “Good morning, Mr. Samsa”. “He isn’t well”, said his\\nmother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through\\nthe door. “He isn’t well, please believe me. Why else would Gregor have\\nmissed a train! The lad only ever thinks about the business. It nearly\\nmakes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings; he’s been in\\ntown for a week now but stayed home every evening. He sits with us in\\nthe kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables. His\\nidea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw. He’s made a little\\nframe, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you’ll be\\namazed how nice it is; it’s hanging up in his room; you’ll see it as\\nsoon as Gregor opens the door. Anyway, I’m glad you’re here; we\\nwouldn’t have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves;\\nhe’s so stubborn; and I’m sure he isn’t well, he said this morning that\\nhe is, but he isn’t.” “I’ll be there in a moment”, said Gregor slowly\\nand thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word\\nof the conversation. “Well I can’t think of any other way of explaining\\nit, Mrs. Samsa”, said the chief clerk, “I hope it’s nothing serious.\\nBut on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever\\nbecome slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like,\\nwe simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.” “Can\\nthe chief clerk come in to see you now then?”, asked his father\\nimpatiently, knocking at the door again. “No”, said Gregor. In the room\\non his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left\\nhis sister began to cry.\\n\\nSo why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only\\njust got up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was she\\ncrying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief\\nclerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that\\nhappened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same\\ndemands as before? There was no need to worry about things like that\\nyet. Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of\\nabandoning his family. For the time being he just lay there on the\\ncarpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would seriously\\nhave expected him to let the chief clerk in. It was only a minor\\ndiscourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later\\non, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot.\\nAnd it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace\\ninstead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying. But the\\nothers didn’t know what was happening, they were worried, that would\\nexcuse their behaviour.\\n\\nThe chief clerk now raised his voice, “Mr. Samsa”, he called to him,\\n“what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more\\nthan yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary\\nconcern to your parents and you fail—and I mention this just by the\\nway—you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite\\nunheard of. I’m speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your\\nemployer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation. I\\nam astonished, quite astonished. I thought I knew you as a calm and\\nsensible person, and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with\\npeculiar whims. This morning, your employer did suggest a possible\\nreason for your failure to appear, it’s true—it had to do with the\\nmoney that was recently entrusted to you—but I came near to giving him\\nmy word of honour that that could not be the right explanation. But now\\nthat I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish\\nwhatsoever to intercede on your behalf. And nor is your position all\\nthat secure. I had originally intended to say all this to you in\\nprivate, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good\\nreason I don’t see why your parents should not also learn of it. Your\\nturnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it’s\\nnot the time of year to do especially good business, we recognise that;\\nbut there simply is no time of year to do no business at all, Mr.\\nSamsa, we cannot allow there to be.”\\n\\n“But Sir”, called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the\\nexcitement, “I’ll open up immediately, just a moment. I’m slightly\\nunwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven’t been able to get up. I’m\\nstill in bed now. I’m quite fresh again now, though. I’m just getting\\nout of bed. Just a moment. Be patient! It’s not quite as easy as I’d\\nthought. I’m quite alright now, though. It’s shocking, what can\\nsuddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright last night, my parents\\nknow about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it last\\nnight already. They must have noticed it. I don’t know why I didn’t let\\nyou know at work! But you always think you can get over an illness\\nwithout staying at home. Please, don’t make my parents suffer! There’s\\nno basis for any of the accusations you’re making; nobody’s ever said a\\nword to me about any of these things. Maybe you haven’t read the latest\\ncontracts I sent in. I’ll set off with the eight o’clock train, as\\nwell, these few hours of rest have given me strength. You don’t need to\\nwait, sir; I’ll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good\\nas to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him!”\\n\\nAnd while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was\\nsaying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers—this was easily\\ndone, probably because of the practise he had already had in bed—where\\nhe now tried to get himself upright. He really did want to open the\\ndoor, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief\\nclerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn\\nwhat they would say when they caught sight of him. If they were shocked\\nthen it would no longer be Gregor’s responsibility and he could rest.\\nIf, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no reason\\nto be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at the station for\\neight o’clock. The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth\\nchest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself\\none last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was\\nin serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let\\nhimself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the\\nedges of it with his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and\\nkept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.\\n\\n“Did you understand a word of all that?” the chief clerk asked his\\nparents, “surely he’s not trying to make fools of us”. “Oh, God!”\\ncalled his mother, who was already in tears, “he could be seriously ill\\nand we’re making him suffer. Grete! Grete!” she then cried. “Mother?”\\nhis sister called from the other side. They communicated across\\nGregor’s room. “You’ll have to go for the doctor straight away. Gregor\\nis ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just\\nnow?” “That was the voice of an animal”, said the chief clerk, with a\\ncalmness that was in contrast with his mother’s screams. “Anna! Anna!”\\nhis father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping\\nhis hands, “get a locksmith here, now!” And the two girls, their skirts\\nswishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the\\nfront door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get\\ndressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again;\\nthey must have left it open; people often do in homes where something\\nawful has happened.\\n\\nGregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn’t\\nunderstand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to\\nhim, clearer than before—perhaps his ears had become used to the sound.\\nThey had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and\\nwere ready to help. The first response to his situation had been\\nconfident and wise, and that made him feel better. He felt that he had\\nbeen drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith\\nhe expected great and surprising achievements—although he did not\\nreally distinguish one from the other. Whatever was said next would be\\ncrucial, so, in order to make his voice as clear as possible, he\\ncoughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even\\nthis might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he\\nwas no longer sure he could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, it had\\nbecome very quiet in the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the\\ntable whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed\\nagainst the door and listening.\\n\\nGregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once\\nthere he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself\\nupright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. He\\nrested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and\\nthen set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his\\nmouth. He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth—how was he,\\nthen, to grasp the key?—but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up\\nfor with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really was able to start\\nthe key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some\\nkind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the\\nkey and dripped onto the floor. “Listen”, said the chief clerk in the\\nnext room, “he’s turning the key.” Gregor was greatly encouraged by\\nthis; but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his\\nmother too: “Well done, Gregor”, they should have cried, “keep at it,\\nkeep hold of the lock!” And with the idea that they were all excitedly\\nfollowing his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying\\nno attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key turned\\nround he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright\\nwith his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the\\nwhole weight of his body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as it\\nsnapped back was Gregor’s sign that he could break his concentration,\\nand as he regained his breath he said to himself: “So, I didn’t need\\nthe locksmith after all”. Then he lay his head on the handle of the\\ndoor to open it completely.\\n\\nBecause he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open\\nbefore he could be seen. He had first to slowly turn himself around one\\nof the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not\\nwant to fall flat on his back before entering the room. He was still\\noccupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to\\nanything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud “Oh!”,\\nwhich sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now he also saw him—he was\\nthe nearest to the door—his hand pressed against his open mouth and\\nslowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force.\\nGregor’s mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief\\nclerk’s being there, looked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms,\\ntook two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into\\nher skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head\\ndisappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and\\nclenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room.\\nThen he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with\\nhis hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.\\n\\nSo Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the\\nother door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half\\nof his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant\\nover to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had\\nbecome much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the\\nother side of the street—which was a hospital—could be seen quite\\nclearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its\\nfaçade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual\\ndroplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from\\nbreakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for\\nGregor’s father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and\\nhe would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of\\ndifferent newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph\\nof Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand\\nand a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his\\nuniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the\\nfront door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and\\nthe stairs where they began their way down below.\\n\\n“Now, then”, said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to have\\nkept calm, “I’ll get dressed straight away now, pack up my samples and\\nset off. Will you please just let me leave? You can see”, he said to\\nthe chief clerk, “that I’m not stubborn and I like to do my job; being\\na commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn’t\\nearn my living. So where are you going, in to the office? Yes? Will you\\nreport everything accurately, then? It’s quite possible for someone to\\nbe temporarily unable to work, but that’s just the right time to\\nremember what’s been achieved in the past and consider that later on,\\nonce the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all\\nthe more diligence and concentration. You’re well aware that I’m\\nseriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my\\nparents and my sister, so that I’m trapped in a difficult situation,\\nbut I will work my way out of it again. Please don’t make things any\\nharder for me than they are already, and don’t take sides against me at\\nthe office. I know that nobody likes the travellers. They think we earn\\nan enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it. That’s just\\nprejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it. But\\nyou, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in\\nfact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss\\nhimself—it’s very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes\\nabout his employees and judge them more harshly than he should. And\\nyou’re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year\\naway from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip\\nand chance and groundless complaints, and it’s almost impossible to\\ndefend yourself from that sort of thing, we don’t usually even hear\\nabout them, or if at all it’s when we arrive back home exhausted from a\\ntrip, and that’s when we feel the harmful effects of what’s been going\\non without even knowing what caused them. Please, don’t go away, at\\nleast first say something to show that you grant that I’m at least\\npartly right!”\\n\\nBut the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to\\nspeak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his\\ntrembling shoulders as he left. He did not keep still for a moment\\nwhile Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without\\ntaking his eyes off him. He moved very gradually, as if there had been\\nsome secret prohibition on leaving the room. It was only when he had\\nreached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement, drew his foot\\nfrom the living room, and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall, he\\nstretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there,\\nthere were some supernatural force waiting to save him.\\n\\nGregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk\\ngo away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into\\nextreme danger. That was something his parents did not understand very\\nwell; over the years, they had become convinced that this job would\\nprovide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much\\nto worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for\\nthe future. Gregor, though, did think about the future. The chief clerk\\nhad to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the\\nfuture of Gregor and his family depended on it! If only his sister were\\nhere! She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still\\nlying peacefully on his back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women,\\nsurely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the\\nentrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state. But his sister was\\nnot there, Gregor would have to do the job himself. And without\\nconsidering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move\\nabout in his present state, or that his speech still might not—or\\nprobably would not—be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself\\nthrough the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who,\\nridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but\\nGregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought\\nsomething to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs. Hardly had\\nthat happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feel\\nalright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under them;\\nto his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were even\\nmaking the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and he was soon\\nbelieving that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end. He held\\nback the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there\\non the floor. His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed,\\nat first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up\\nwith her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: “Help, for\\npity’s sake, Help!” The way she held her head suggested she wanted to\\nsee Gregor better, but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards\\nshowed that she did not; she had forgotten that the table was behind\\nher with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the table she\\nsat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even\\nseeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush\\nof coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.\\n\\n“Mother, mother”, said Gregor gently, looking up at her. He had\\ncompletely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help\\nhimself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of\\ncoffee. That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from the table and\\ninto the arms of his father as he rushed towards her. Gregor, though,\\nhad no time to spare for his parents now; the chief clerk had already\\nreached the stairs; with his chin on the banister, he looked back for\\nthe last time. Gregor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of\\nreaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt\\ndown several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all\\naround the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed,\\nunfortunately, to put Gregor’s father into a panic as well. Until then\\nhe had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running\\nafter the chief clerk himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he\\nran after him, Gregor’s father seized the chief clerk’s stick in his\\nright hand (the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with\\nhis hat and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with\\nhis left, and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping\\nhis foot at him as he went. Gregor’s appeals to his father were of no\\nhelp, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly\\nturned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.\\nAcross the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor’s mother had pulled\\nopen a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face. A\\nstrong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the\\ncurtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of\\nthem were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop Gregor’s father as\\nhe drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man. Gregor\\nhad never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go\\nvery slowly. If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would\\nhave been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he\\ntook the time to do that his father would become impatient, and there\\nwas the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in\\nhis father’s hand any moment. Eventually, though, Gregor realised that\\nhe had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable\\nof going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as\\npossible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn\\nhimself round. It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able to\\nsee his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact now\\nand then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a\\ndistance as to which way to turn. If only his father would stop that\\nunbearable hissing! It was making Gregor quite confused. When he had\\nnearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, he made\\na mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come. He\\nwas pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway, but\\nthen saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get\\nthrough it without further difficulty. In his present mood, it\\nobviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double\\ndoors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through. He was\\nmerely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room\\nas quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time\\nto get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway.\\nWhat he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards\\nall the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to\\nGregor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not\\na pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway\\nwithout regard for what might happen. One side of his body lifted\\nitself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the\\nwhite door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it,\\nsoon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by\\nhimself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while\\nthose on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground. Then\\nhis father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from\\nwhere he was held and sent him flying, and heavily bleeding, deep into\\nhis room. The door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all\\nwas quiet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\n\\nIt was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke\\nfrom his deep and coma-like sleep. He would have woken soon afterwards\\nanyway even if he hadn’t been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep and\\nfelt fully rested. But he had the impression that some hurried steps\\nand the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully\\nshut had woken him. The light from the electric street lamps shone\\npalely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but\\ndown below, where Gregor was, it was dark. He pushed himself over to\\nthe door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae—of which he was\\nnow beginning to learn the value—in order to see what had been\\nhappening there. The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully\\nstretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs. One of the\\nlegs had been badly injured in the events of that morning—it was nearly\\na miracle that only one of them had been—and dragged along lifelessly.\\n\\nIt was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it\\nactually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of\\nsomething to eat. By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened\\nmilk with little pieces of white bread floating in it. He was so\\npleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he had been\\nthat morning, and immediately dipped his head into the milk, nearly\\ncovering his eyes with it. But he soon drew his head back again in\\ndisappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left side make it\\ndifficult to eat the food—he was only able to eat if his whole body\\nworked together as a snuffling whole—but the milk did not taste at all\\nnice. Milk like this was normally his favourite drink, and his sister\\nhad certainly left it there for him because of that, but he turned,\\nalmost against his own will, away from the dish and crawled back into\\nthe centre of the room.\\n\\nThrough the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been\\nlit in the living room. His father at this time would normally be sat\\nwith his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor’s\\nmother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not a sound to\\nbe heard. Gregor’s sister would often write and tell him about this\\nreading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times. It\\nwas so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody\\nin the flat. “What a quiet life it is the family lead”, said Gregor to\\nhimself, and, gazing into the darkness, felt a great pride that he was\\nable to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and\\nparents. But what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should\\ncome to a horrible and frightening end? That was something that Gregor\\ndid not want to think about too much, so he started to move about,\\ncrawling up and down the room.\\n\\nOnce during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was\\nopened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on\\nthe other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the\\nroom but thought better of it. Gregor went and waited immediately by\\nthe door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room\\nin some way or at least to find out who it was; but the door was opened\\nno more that night and Gregor waited in vain. The previous morning\\nwhile the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him,\\nbut now, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had\\nclearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the\\nkeys were in the other sides.\\n\\nIt was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was\\nput out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had\\nstayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as\\nthey went away together on tip-toe. It was clear that no-one would come\\ninto Gregor’s room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time\\nto think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life.\\nFor some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain\\nmade him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor, even though he\\nhad been living in it for five years. Hardly aware of what he was doing\\nother than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch. It\\npressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able to lift\\nhis head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only\\nregret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath.\\n\\nHe spent the whole night there. Some of the time he passed in a light\\nsleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his\\nhunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes\\nwhich, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being\\nhe must remain calm, he must show patience and the greatest\\nconsideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he,\\nin his present condition, was forced to impose on them.\\n\\nGregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions,\\nas early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his\\nsister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and\\nlooked anxiously in. She did not see him straight away, but when she\\ndid notice him under the couch—he had to be somewhere, for God’s sake,\\nhe couldn’t have flown away—she was so shocked that she lost control of\\nherself and slammed the door shut again from outside. But she seemed to\\nregret her behaviour, as she opened the door again straight away and\\ncame in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or\\neven of a stranger. Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the\\nedge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that he had left\\nthe milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and\\nbring him in some other food that was more suitable? If she didn’t do\\nit herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it,\\nalthough he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the\\ncouch, throw himself at his sister’s feet and beg her for something\\ngood to eat. However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and\\nlooked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some\\nsurprise. She immediately picked it up—using a rag, not her bare\\nhands—and carried it out. Gregor was extremely curious as to what she\\nwould bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he\\nnever could have guessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did\\nbring. In order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of\\nthings, all spread out on an old newspaper. There were old, half-rotten\\nvegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that\\nhad gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had\\ndeclared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread\\nwith butter and salt. As well as all that she had poured some water\\ninto the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for\\nGregor’s use, and placed it beside them. Then, out of consideration for\\nGregor’s feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her,\\nshe hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that\\nGregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he\\nliked. Gregor’s little legs whirred, at last he could eat. What’s more,\\nhis injuries must already have completely healed as he found no\\ndifficulty in moving. This amazed him, as more than a month earlier he\\nhad cut his finger slightly with a knife, he thought of how his finger\\nhad still hurt the day before yesterday. “Am I less sensitive than I\\nused to be, then?”, he thought, and was already sucking greedily at the\\ncheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much\\nmore than the other foods on the newspaper. Quickly one after another,\\nhis eyes watering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables\\nand the sauce; the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn’t like at\\nall, and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away\\nfrom them because he couldn’t stand the smell. Long after he had\\nfinished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly\\nturned the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw. He\\nwas immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he\\nhurried back under the couch. But he needed great self-control to stay\\nthere even for the short time that his sister was in the room, as\\neating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could\\nhardly breathe in that narrow space. Half suffocating, he watched with\\nbulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up\\nthe left-overs, mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at\\nall as if it could not be used any more. She quickly dropped it all\\ninto a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out.\\nShe had hardly turned her back before Gregor came out again from under\\nthe couch and stretched himself.\\n\\nThis was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the morning\\nwhile his parents and the maid were still asleep, and the second time\\nafter everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would\\nsleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor’s sister would send\\nthe maid away on some errand. Gregor’s father and mother certainly did\\nnot want him to starve either, but perhaps it would have been more than\\nthey could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being\\ntold about it, and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what\\ndistress she could as they were indeed suffering enough.\\n\\nIt was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor\\nand the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat. As\\nnobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister, thought that\\nhe could understand them, so he had to be content to hear his sister’s\\nsighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room. It was\\nonly later, when she had become a little more used to everything—there\\nwas, of course, no question of her ever becoming fully used to the\\nsituation—that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at\\nleast a comment that could be construed as friendly. “He’s enjoyed his\\ndinner today”, she might say when he had diligently cleared away all\\nthe food left for him, or if he left most of it, which slowly became\\nmore and more frequent, she would often say, sadly, “now everything’s\\njust been left there again”.\\n\\nAlthough Gregor wasn’t able to hear any news directly he did listen to\\nmuch of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heard anyone\\nspeaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his\\nwhole body against it. There was seldom any conversation, especially at\\nfirst, that was not about him in some way, even if only in secret. For\\ntwo whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what they\\nshould do now; but even between meals they spoke about the same subject\\nas there were always at least two members of the family at home—nobody\\nwanted to be at home by themselves and it was out of the question to\\nleave the flat entirely empty. And on the very first day the maid had\\nfallen to her knees and begged Gregor’s mother to let her go without\\ndelay. It was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but\\nshe left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor’s\\nmother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service.\\nShe even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what\\nhad happened, even though no-one had asked that of her.\\n\\nNow Gregor’s sister also had to help his mother with the cooking;\\nalthough that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much. Gregor\\noften heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat,\\nand receive no more answer than “no thanks, I’ve had enough” or\\nsomething similar. No-one drank very much either. His sister would\\nsometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping for the\\nchance to go and fetch it herself. When his father then said nothing\\nshe would add, so that he would not feel selfish, that she could send\\nthe housekeeper for it, but then his father would close the matter with\\na big, loud “No”, and no more would be said.\\n\\nEven before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained\\nto Gregor’s mother and sister what their finances and prospects were.\\nNow and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or\\ndocument from the little cash box he had saved from his business when\\nit had collapsed five years earlier. Gregor heard how he opened the\\ncomplicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item\\nhe wanted. What he heard his father say was some of the first good news\\nthat Gregor heard since he had first been incarcerated in his room. He\\nhad thought that nothing at all remained from his father’s business, at\\nleast he had never told him anything different, and Gregor had never\\nasked him about it anyway. Their business misfortune had reduced the\\nfamily to a state of total despair, and Gregor’s only concern at that\\ntime had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it\\nas quickly as possible. So then he started working especially hard,\\nwith a fiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a\\ntravelling representative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance\\nto earn money in quite different ways. Gregor converted his success at\\nwork straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the\\nbenefit of his astonished and delighted family. They had been good\\ntimes and they had never come again, at least not with the same\\nsplendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a\\nposition to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them. They\\nhad even got used to it, both Gregor and the family, they took the\\nmoney with gratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was\\nno longer much warm affection given in return. Gregor only remained\\nclose to his sister now. Unlike him, she was very fond of music and a\\ngifted and expressive violinist, it was his secret plan to send her to\\nthe conservatory next year even though it would cause great expense\\nthat would have to be made up for in some other way. During Gregor’s\\nshort periods in town, conversation with his sister would often turn to\\nthe conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that\\ncould never be realised. Their parents did not like to hear this\\ninnocent talk, but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he\\nwould let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it on\\nChristmas day.\\n\\nThat was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind\\nin his present state, pressed upright against the door and listening.\\nThere were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening,\\nwhen his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it\\nup again with a start, as even the slightest noise he caused would be\\nheard next door and they would all go silent. “What’s that he’s doing\\nnow”, his father would say after a while, clearly having gone over to\\nthe door, and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be\\ntaken up again.\\n\\nWhen explaining things, his father repeated himself several times,\\npartly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these\\nmatters himself and partly because Gregor’s mother did not understand\\neverything the first time. From these repeated explanations Gregor\\nlearned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was\\nstill some money available from the old days. It was not a lot, but it\\nhad not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated.\\nBesides that, they had not been using up all the money that Gregor had\\nbeen bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so\\nthat that, too, had been accumulating. Behind the door, Gregor nodded\\nwith enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution.\\nHe could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father’s\\ndebt to his boss, and the day when he could have freed himself from\\nthat job would have come much closer, but now it was certainly better\\nthe way his father had done things.\\n\\nThis money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to\\nlive off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one\\nor two years, no more. That’s to say, it was money that should not\\nreally be touched but set aside for emergencies; money to live on had\\nto be earned. His father was healthy but old, and lacking in self\\nconfidence. During the five years that he had not been working—the\\nfirst holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success—he\\nhad put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy. Would\\nGregor’s elderly mother now have to go and earn money? She suffered\\nfrom asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home,\\nevery other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the\\nopen window. Would his sister have to go and earn money? She was still\\na child of seventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable,\\nconsisting of wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the\\nbusiness, joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all\\nplaying the violin. Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn\\nmoney, Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw\\nhimself onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot\\nwith shame and regret.\\n\\nHe would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink\\nbut scratching at the leather for hours on end. Or he might go to all\\nthe effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill\\nand, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to stare out of it.\\nHe had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing\\nit now was obviously something more remembered than experienced, as\\nwhat he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day,\\neven things that were quite near; he had used to curse the ever-present\\nview of the hospital across the street, but now he could not see it at\\nall, and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which\\nwas a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could\\nhave thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where\\nthe grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably. His observant\\nsister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always\\npush it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied\\nup the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then\\non.\\n\\nIf Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for\\nall that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to\\nbear it; but as it was it caused him pain. His sister, naturally, tried\\nas far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it,\\nand the longer it went on, of course, the better she was able to do so,\\nbut as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much\\nbetter. It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she\\nentered the room. No sooner had she come in than she would quickly\\nclose the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the\\nview into Gregor’s room, then she would go straight to the window and\\npull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if it\\nwas cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little\\nwhile. She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and\\nnoise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while,\\nknowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this\\nordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him\\nwith the windows closed.\\n\\nOne day, about a month after Gregor’s transformation when his sister no\\nlonger had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance, she\\ncame into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still\\nstaring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be most\\nhorrible. In itself, his sister’s not coming into the room would have\\nbeen no surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult for her to\\nimmediately open the window while he was still there, but not only did\\nshe not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her,\\na stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite\\nher. Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch, of course,\\nbut he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she\\nseemed much more uneasy than usual. It made him realise that she still\\nfound his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, she\\nprobably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little\\nbit of him that protruded from under the couch. One day, in order to\\nspare her even this sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet\\nover to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely\\ncovered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent\\ndown. If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to\\ndo was take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no\\npleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely. She left the\\nsheet where it was. Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude\\none time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how\\nhis sister liked the new arrangement.\\n\\nFor the first fourteen days, Gregor’s parents could not bring\\nthemselves to come into the room to see him. He would often hear them\\nsay how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even\\nthough, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless\\nand frequently been annoyed with her. But now the two of them, father\\nand mother, would often both wait outside the door of Gregor’s room\\nwhile his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she went out again\\nshe would have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Gregor\\nhad eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any\\nslight improvement could be seen. His mother also wanted to go in and\\nvisit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first\\npersuaded her against it. Gregor listened very closely to all this, and\\napproved fully. Later, though, she had to be held back by force, which\\nmade her call out: “Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son!\\nCan’t you understand I have to see him?”, and Gregor would think to\\nhimself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every\\nday of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand\\neverything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was\\nstill just a child after all, and really might not have had an adult’s\\nappreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.\\n\\nGregor’s wish to see his mother was soon realised. Out of consideration\\nfor his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during\\nthe day, the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room\\nto crawl about, it was hard to just lie quietly through the night, his\\nfood soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain\\nhimself, he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and\\nceiling. He was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling; it was\\nquite different from lying on the floor; he could breathe more freely;\\nhis body had a light swing to it; and up there, relaxed and almost\\nhappy, it might happen that he would surprise even himself by letting\\ngo of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash. But now, of\\ncourse, he had far better control of his body than before and, even\\nwith a fall as great as that, caused himself no damage. Very soon his\\nsister noticed Gregor’s new way of entertaining himself—he had, after\\nall, left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about—and\\ngot it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing\\nthe furniture that got in his way, especially the chest of drawers and\\nthe desk. Now, this was not something that she would be able to do by\\nherself; she did not dare to ask for help from her father; the sixteen\\nyear old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she\\ncertainly would not have helped in this, she had even asked to be\\nallowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to\\nopen the door unless it was especially important; so his sister had no\\nchoice but to choose some time when Gregor’s father was not there and\\nfetch his mother to help her. As she approached the room, Gregor could\\nhear his mother express her joy, but once at the door she went silent.\\nFirst, of course, his sister came in and looked round to see that\\neverything in the room was alright; and only then did she let her\\nmother enter. Gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the\\ncouch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if\\nit had just been thrown down by chance. Gregor also refrained, this\\ntime, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to\\nsee his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come. “You\\ncan come in, he can’t be seen”, said his sister, obviously leading her\\nin by the hand. The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of\\nfeeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they pushed it\\nfrom its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the\\nwork for herself and ignoring her mother’s warnings that she would\\nstrain herself. This lasted a very long time. After labouring at it for\\nfifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the\\nchest where it was, for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the\\njob finished before Gregor’s father got home and leaving it in the\\nmiddle of the room it would be in his way even more, and for another\\nthing it wasn’t even sure that taking the furniture away would really\\nbe any help to him. She thought just the opposite; the sight of the\\nbare walls saddened her right to her heart; and why wouldn’t Gregor\\nfeel the same way about it, he’d been used to this furniture in his\\nroom for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an\\nempty room like that. Then, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting\\nGregor (whose whereabouts she did not know) to hear not even the tone\\nof her voice, as she was convinced that he did not understand her\\nwords, she added “and by taking the furniture away, won’t it seem like\\nwe’re showing that we’ve given up all hope of improvement and we’re\\nabandoning him to cope for himself? I think it’d be best to leave the\\nroom exactly the way it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us\\nagain he’ll find everything unchanged and he’ll be able to forget the\\ntime in between all the easier”.\\n\\nHearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the lack\\nof any direct human communication, along with the monotonous life led\\nby the family during these two months, must have made him confused—he\\ncould think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had\\nseriously wanted his room emptied out. Had he really wanted to\\ntransform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice\\nfurniture he had inherited? That would have let him crawl around\\nunimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let him quickly\\nforget his past when he had still been human. He had come very close to\\nforgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for\\nso long, that had shaken him out of it. Nothing should be removed;\\neverything had to stay; he could not do without the good influence the\\nfurniture had on his condition; and if the furniture made it difficult\\nfor him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great\\nadvantage.\\n\\nHis sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the\\nidea, not without reason, that she was Gregor’s spokesman to his\\nparents about the things that concerned him. This meant that his\\nmother’s advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing\\nnot only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she had thought at\\nfirst, but all the furniture apart from the all-important couch. It was\\nmore than childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected confidence\\nshe had recently acquired, that made her insist; she had indeed noticed\\nthat Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the\\nfurniture, as far as anyone could see, was of no use to him at all.\\nGirls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel\\nthey must get their way whenever they can. Perhaps this was what\\ntempted Grete to make Gregor’s situation seem even more shocking than\\nit was so that she could do even more for him. Grete would probably be\\nthe only one who would dare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling\\nabout the bare walls by himself.\\n\\nSo she refused to let her mother dissuade her. Gregor’s mother already\\nlooked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and helped\\nGregor’s sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she\\nhad. The chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without if\\nhe had to, but the writing desk had to stay. Hardly had the two women\\npushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out of the room than Gregor\\npoked his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about\\nit. He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could, but,\\nunfortunately, it was his mother who came back first while Grete in the\\nnext room had her arms round the chest, pushing and pulling at it from\\nside to side by herself without, of course, moving it an inch. His\\nmother was not used to the sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill,\\nso Gregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch. In his\\nstartlement, though, he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front\\nfrom moving a little. It was enough to attract his mother’s attention.\\nShe stood very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out\\nto Grete.\\n\\nGregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was\\nhappening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all,\\nbut he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their little\\ncalls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor, all\\nthese things made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides.\\nWith his head and legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to\\nthe floor, he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand\\nall of this much longer. They were emptying his room out; taking away\\neverything that was dear to him; they had already taken out the chest\\ncontaining his fretsaw and other tools; now they threatened to remove\\nthe writing desk with its place clearly worn into the floor, the desk\\nwhere he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school,\\neven while he had been at infant school—he really could not wait any\\nlonger to see whether the two women’s intentions were good. He had\\nnearly forgotten they were there anyway, as they were now too tired to\\nsay anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as\\nthey stepped heavily on the floor.\\n\\nSo, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room\\ncatching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times not\\nknowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly\\ncaught by the picture on the wall—which was already denuded of\\neverything else that had been on it—of the lady dressed in copious fur.\\nHe hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass,\\nit held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly. This picture at\\nleast, now totally covered by Gregor, would certainly be taken away by\\nno-one. He turned his head to face the door into the living room so\\nthat he could watch the women when they came back.\\n\\nThey had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon;\\nGrete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her.\\n“What shall we take now, then?”, said Grete and looked around. Her eyes\\nmet those of Gregor on the wall. Perhaps only because her mother was\\nthere, she remained calm, bent her face to her so that she would not\\nlook round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice:\\n“Come on, let’s go back in the living room for a while?” Gregor could\\nsee what Grete had in mind, she wanted to take her mother somewhere\\nsafe and then chase him down from the wall. Well, she could certainly\\ntry it! He sat unyielding on his picture. He would rather jump at\\nGrete’s face.\\n\\nBut Grete’s words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to one\\nside, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the\\nwallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw\\nscreamed: “Oh God, oh God!” Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch\\nas if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile. “Gregor!”\\nshouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist. That was the\\nfirst word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation. She\\nran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring\\nher mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted to help too—he could save\\nhis picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull\\nhimself off by force; then he, too, ran into the next room as if he\\ncould advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to just stand\\nbehind her doing nothing; she was looking into various bottles, he\\nstartled her when she turned round; a bottle fell to the ground and\\nbroke; a splinter cut Gregor’s face, some kind of caustic medicine\\nsplashed all over him; now, without delaying any longer, Grete took\\nhold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother;\\nshe slammed the door shut with her foot. So now Gregor was shut out\\nfrom his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death; he could\\nnot open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she\\nhad to stay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait;\\nand, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about,\\nhe crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in\\nhis confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down\\ninto the middle of the dinner table.\\n\\nHe lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was\\nquiet, maybe that was a good sign. Then there was someone at the door.\\nThe maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete\\nwould have to go and answer it. His father had arrived home. “What’s\\nhappened?” were his first words; Grete’s appearance must have made\\neverything clear to him. She answered him with subdued voice, and\\nopenly pressed her face into his chest: “Mother’s fainted, but she’s\\nbetter now. Gregor got out.” “Just as I expected”, said his father,\\n“just as I always said, but you women wouldn’t listen, would you.” It\\nwas clear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and that his father\\ntook it to mean that something bad had happened, that he was\\nresponsible for some act of violence. That meant Gregor would now have\\nto try to calm his father, as he did not have the time to explain\\nthings to him even if that had been possible. So he fled to the door of\\nhis room and pressed himself against it so that his father, when he\\ncame in from the hall, could see straight away that Gregor had the best\\nintentions and would go back into his room without delay, that it would\\nnot be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the\\ndoor and he would disappear.\\n\\nHis father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that;\\n“Ah!”, he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were both angry and\\nglad at the same time. Gregor drew his head back from the door and\\nlifted it towards his father. He really had not imagined his father the\\nway he stood there now; of late, with his new habit of crawling about,\\nhe had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the\\nflat the way he had done before. He really ought to have expected\\nthings to have changed, but still, still, was that really his father?\\nThe same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when\\nGregor came back from his business trips, who would receive him sitting\\nin the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings; who\\nwas hardly even able to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would\\njust raise his arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they\\nwent for a walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up\\ntightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always\\nlabour his way forward a little more slowly than them, who were already\\nwalking slowly for his sake; who would place his stick down carefully\\nand, if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his\\ncompanions around him. He was standing up straight enough now; dressed\\nin a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the\\nemployees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff collar of the\\ncoat his strong double-chin emerged; under the bushy eyebrows, his\\npiercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; his normally unkempt\\nwhite hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp. He took his\\ncap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in\\nan arc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his\\ntrouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and,\\nwith look of determination, walked towards Gregor. He probably did not\\neven know himself what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet\\nunusually high. Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of\\nhis boots, but wasted no time with that—he knew full well, right from\\nthe first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to\\nalways be extremely strict with him. And so he ran up to his father,\\nstopped when his father stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved,\\neven slightly. In this way they went round the room several times\\nwithout anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression\\nof a chase as everything went so slowly. Gregor remained all this time\\non the floor, largely because he feared his father might see it as\\nespecially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling. Whatever he\\ndid, Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up\\nthis running about for long, as for each step his father took he had to\\ncarry out countless movements. He became noticeably short of breath,\\neven in his earlier life his lungs had not been very reliable. Now, as\\nhe lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for\\nrunning he could hardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too\\nslow for him to think of any other way of saving himself than running;\\nhe almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although,\\nhere, they were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of\\nnotches and protrusions—then, right beside him, lightly tossed,\\nsomething flew down and rolled in front of him. It was an apple; then\\nanother one immediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was\\nno longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard\\nhim. He had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the\\nsideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw\\none apple after another. These little, red apples rolled about on the\\nfloor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors. An\\napple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor’s back and slid\\noff without doing any harm. Another one however, immediately following\\nit, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag himself\\naway, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible pain by\\nchanging his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread\\nhimself out, all his senses in confusion. The last thing he saw was the\\ndoor of his room being pulled open, his sister was screaming, his\\nmother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as his sister had taken\\noff some of her clothes after she had fainted to make it easier for her\\nto breathe), she ran to his father, her skirts unfastened and sliding\\none after another to the ground, stumbling over the skirts she pushed\\nherself to his father, her arms around him, uniting herself with him\\ntotally—now Gregor lost his ability to see anything—her hands behind\\nhis father’s head begging him to spare Gregor’s life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\n\\nNo-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor’s flesh, so it\\nremained there as a visible reminder of his injury. He had suffered it\\nthere for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious enough to\\nremind even his father that Gregor, despite his current sad and\\nrevolting form, was a family member who could not be treated as an\\nenemy. On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to swallow any\\nrevulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.\\n\\nBecause of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility—probably\\npermanently. He had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid\\nand it took him long, long minutes to crawl across his room—crawling\\nover the ceiling was out of the question—but this deterioration in his\\ncondition was fully (in his opinion) made up for by the door to the\\nliving room being left open every evening. He got into the habit of\\nclosely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then,\\nlying in the darkness of his room where he could not be seen from the\\nliving room, he could watch the family in the light of the dinner table\\nand listen to their conversation—with everyone’s permission, in a way,\\nand thus quite differently from before.\\n\\nThey no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of\\ncourse, the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing when he\\nwas tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room. All\\nof them were usually very quiet nowadays. Soon after dinner, his father\\nwould go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each\\nother to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew\\nfancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, who had taken a sales\\njob, learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that she might be\\nable to get a better position later on. Sometimes his father would wake\\nup and say to Gregor’s mother “you’re doing so much sewing again\\ntoday!”, as if he did not know that he had been dozing—and then he\\nwould go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a\\ntired grin.\\n\\nWith a kind of stubbornness, Gregor’s father refused to take his\\nuniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg\\nGregor’s father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if always\\nready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even\\nhere. The uniform had not been new to start with, but as a result of\\nthis it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of Gregor’s\\nmother and sister to look after it. Gregor would often spend the whole\\nevening looking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons\\nalways kept polished and shiny, while the old man in it would sleep,\\nhighly uncomfortable but peaceful.\\n\\nAs soon as it struck ten, Gregor’s mother would speak gently to his\\nfather to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn’t\\nsleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he\\nwas to be up at six to get to work. But since he had been in work he\\nhad become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at\\nthe table, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder\\nthan ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed. Then,\\nhowever much mother and sister would importune him with little\\nreproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a\\nquarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up.\\nGregor’s mother would tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his\\near, Gregor’s sister would leave her work to help her mother, but\\nnothing would have any effect on him. He would just sink deeper into\\nhis chair. Only when the two women took him under the arms he would\\nabruptly open his eyes, look at them one after the other and say: “What\\na life! This is what peace I get in my old age!” And supported by the\\ntwo women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the\\ngreatest load himself, let the women take him to the door, send them\\noff and carry on by himself while Gregor’s mother would throw down her\\nneedle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father\\nand continue being of help to him.\\n\\nWho, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to give\\nmore attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary? The household\\nbudget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed; an enormous,\\nthick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came\\nevery morning and evening to do the heaviest work; everything else was\\nlooked after by Gregor’s mother on top of the large amount of sewing\\nwork she did. Gregor even learned, listening to the evening\\nconversation about what price they had hoped for, that several items of\\njewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even though both\\nmother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and\\ncelebrations. But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was\\nmuch too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out\\nof it, there was no imaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new\\naddress. He could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons\\nthan consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it\\nwould have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with\\na few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family back from\\ntheir decision to move was much more to do with their total despair,\\nand the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike\\nanything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to. They\\ncarried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor\\npeople, Gregor’s father brought bank employees their breakfast, his\\nmother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers, his sister\\nran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers, but\\nthey just did not have the strength to do any more. And the injury in\\nGregor’s back began to hurt as much as when it was new. After they had\\ncome back from taking his father to bed Gregor’s mother and sister\\nwould now leave their work where it was and sit close together, cheek\\nto cheek; his mother would point to Gregor’s room and say “Close that\\ndoor, Grete”, and then, when he was in the dark again, they would sit\\nin the next room and their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit\\nthere staring dry-eyed at the table.\\n\\nGregor hardly slept at all, either night or day. Sometimes he would\\nthink of taking over the family’s affairs, just like before, the next\\ntime the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss and the\\nchief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts, the salesmen\\nand the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from\\nother businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel, a\\ntender memory that appeared and disappeared again, a cashier from a hat\\nshop for whom his attention had been serious but too slow,—all of them\\nappeared to him, mixed together with strangers and others he had\\nforgotten, but instead of helping him and his family they were all of\\nthem inaccessible, and he was glad when they disappeared. Other times\\nhe was not at all in the mood to look after his family, he was filled\\nwith simple rage about the lack of attention he was shown, and although\\nhe could think of nothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he\\ncould get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was\\nentitled to, even if he was not hungry. Gregor’s sister no longer\\nthought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some\\nfood or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work\\nin the morning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it\\naway again with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten\\nor—more often than not—had been left totally untouched. She still\\ncleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been any\\nquicker about it. Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there\\nwere little balls of dust and filth. At first, Gregor went into one of\\nthe worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her,\\nbut he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing\\nanything about it; she could see the dirt as well as he could but she\\nhad simply decided to leave him to it. At the same time she became\\ntouchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the\\nfamily understood—cleaning up Gregor’s room was for her and her alone.\\nGregor’s mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use\\nseveral bucketfuls of water to do it—although that much dampness also\\nmade Gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile. But\\nhis mother was to be punished still more for what she had done, as\\nhardly had his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the\\nchange in Gregor’s room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living\\nroom where, despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, she broke\\ninto convulsive tears. Her father, of course, was startled out of his\\nchair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless; then they,\\ntoo, became agitated; Gregor’s father, standing to the right of his\\nmother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning of Gregor’s room to his\\nsister; from her left, Gregor’s sister screamed at her that she was\\nnever to clean Gregor’s room again; while his mother tried to draw his\\nfather, who was beside himself with anger, into the bedroom; his\\nsister, quaking with tears, thumped on the table with her small fists;\\nand Gregor hissed in anger that no-one had even thought of closing the\\ndoor to save him the sight of this and all its noise.\\n\\nGregor’s sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after\\nGregor as she had done before was even more work for her, but even so\\nhis mother ought certainly not to have taken her place. Gregor, on the\\nother hand, ought not to be neglected. Now, though, the charwoman was\\nhere. This elderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made her\\nable to withstand the hardest of things in her long life, wasn’t really\\nrepelled by Gregor. Just by chance one day, rather than any real\\ncuriosity, she opened the door to Gregor’s room and found herself face\\nto face with him. He was taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing\\nhim but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in\\namazement with her hands crossed in front of her. From then on she\\nnever failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and\\nlook briefly in on him. At first she would call to him as she did so\\nwith words that she probably considered friendly, such as “come on\\nthen, you old dung-beetle!”, or “look at the old dung-beetle there!”\\nGregor never responded to being spoken to in that way, but just\\nremained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been\\nopened. If only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every\\nday instead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt\\nlike it! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the\\nwindowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began to\\nspeak to him in that way once again. Gregor was so resentful of it that\\nhe started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but it was like\\na kind of attack. Instead of being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up\\none of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth\\nopen, clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her\\nhand had been slammed down into Gregor’s back. “Aren’t you coming any\\ncloser, then?”, she asked when Gregor turned round again, and she\\ncalmly put the chair back in the corner.\\n\\nGregor had almost entirely stopped eating. Only if he happened to find\\nhimself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take\\nsome of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours\\nand then, more often than not, spit it out again. At first he thought\\nit was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating, but\\nhe had soon got used to the changes made there. They had got into the\\nhabit of putting things into this room that they had no room for\\nanywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms\\nin the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnest\\ngentlemen—all three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering\\nthrough the crack in the door one day—were painfully insistent on\\nthings’ being tidy. This meant not only in their own room but, since\\nthey had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and\\nespecially in the kitchen. Unnecessary clutter was something they could\\nnot tolerate, especially if it was dirty. They had moreover brought\\nmost of their own furnishings and equipment with them. For this reason,\\nmany things had become superfluous which, although they could not be\\nsold, the family did not wish to discard. All these things found their\\nway into Gregor’s room. The dustbins from the kitchen found their way\\nin there too. The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything she\\ncouldn’t use for the time being she would just chuck in there. He,\\nfortunately, would usually see no more than the object and the hand\\nthat held it. The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out\\nagain when she had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out\\nin one go, but what actually happened was that they were left where\\nthey landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way\\nthrough the junk and moved it somewhere else. At first he moved it\\nbecause, with no other room free where he could crawl about, he was\\nforced to, but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in\\nthat way left him sad and tired to death, and he would remain immobile\\nfor hours afterwards.\\n\\nThe gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening\\nmeal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the\\ndoor to this room was often kept closed in the evening. But Gregor\\nfound it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after all, often\\nfailed to make use of it when it was open and, without the family\\nhaving noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner. One time,\\nthough, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open,\\nand it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in\\nthe evening and the light was put on. They sat up at the table where,\\nformerly, Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother, they\\nunfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks. Gregor’s\\nmother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon\\nbehind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes. The\\nfood was steaming, and filled the room with its smell. The gentlemen\\nbent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the\\nfood before eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to\\ncount as an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of\\nmeat while it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish\\nwhether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to\\nthe kitchen. It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor’s mother and\\nsister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again and\\nsmiled.\\n\\nThe family themselves ate in the kitchen. Nonetheless, Gregor’s father\\ncame into the living room before he went into the kitchen, bowed once\\nwith his cap in his hand and did his round of the table. The gentlemen\\nstood as one, and mumbled something into their beards. Then, once they\\nwere alone, they ate in near perfect silence. It seemed remarkable to\\nGregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth\\ncould still be heard, as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you\\nneed teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything\\nwith jaws that are toothless however nice they might be. “I’d like to\\neat something”, said Gregor anxiously, “but not anything like they’re\\neating. They do feed themselves. And here I am, dying!”\\n\\nThroughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the\\nviolin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the\\nkitchen. The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one\\nin the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the\\nothers, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and\\nsmoking. When the violin began playing they became attentive, stood up\\nand went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they stood\\npressed against each other. Someone must have heard them in the\\nkitchen, as Gregor’s father called out: “Is the playing perhaps\\nunpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away.” “On the\\ncontrary”, said the middle gentleman, “would the young lady not like to\\ncome in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after all, much\\nmore cosy and comfortable?” “Oh yes, we’d love to”, called back\\nGregor’s father as if he had been the violin player himself. The\\ngentlemen stepped back into the room and waited. Gregor’s father soon\\nappeared with the music stand, his mother with the music and his sister\\nwith the violin. She calmly prepared everything for her to begin\\nplaying; his parents, who had never rented a room out before and\\ntherefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen,\\ndid not even dare to sit on their own chairs; his father leant against\\nthe door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his\\nuniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the\\ngentlemen and sat—leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to\\nhave placed it—out of the way in a corner.\\n\\nHis sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention, one\\non each side, to the movements of her hands. Drawn in by the playing,\\nGregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in\\nthe living room. Before, he had taken great pride in how considerate he\\nwas but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless\\nabout the others. What’s more, there was now all the more reason to\\nkeep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust that lay everywhere\\nin his room and flew up at the slightest movement; he carried threads,\\nhairs, and remains of food about on his back and sides; he was much too\\nindifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on\\nthe carpet like he had used to do several times a day. And despite this\\ncondition, he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the\\nimmaculate floor of the living room.\\n\\nNo-one noticed him, though. The family was totally preoccupied with the\\nviolin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put their hands in\\ntheir pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look\\nat all the notes being played, and they must have disturbed Gregor’s\\nsister, but soon, in contrast with the family, they withdrew back to\\nthe window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half\\nvolume, and they stayed by the window while Gregor’s father observed\\nthem anxiously. It really now seemed very obvious that they had\\nexpected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had\\nbeen disappointed, that they had had enough of the whole performance\\nand it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to\\nbe disturbed. It was especially unnerving, the way they all blew the\\nsmoke from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses. Yet\\nGregor’s sister was playing so beautifully. Her face was leant to one\\nside, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy\\nexpression. Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his head\\nclose to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came.\\nWas he an animal if music could captivate him so? It seemed to him that\\nhe was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been\\nyearning for. He was determined to make his way forward to his sister\\nand tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her\\nviolin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He\\nnever wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway;\\nhis shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he\\nwanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the\\nattackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though,\\nbut stay of her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch\\nwith her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always\\nintended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told\\neveryone about it last Christmas—had Christmas really come and gone\\nalready?—if this misfortune hadn’t got in the way, and refuse to let\\nanyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would\\nbreak out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her\\nshoulder and kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to\\nwork, she had kept free without any necklace or collar.\\n\\n“Mr. Samsa!”, shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor’s father,\\npointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at Gregor\\nas he slowly moved forward. The violin went silent, the middle of the\\nthree gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and\\nthen looked back at Gregor. His father seemed to think it more\\nimportant to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even\\nthough they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more\\nentertaining than the violin playing had been. He rushed up to them\\nwith his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their\\nroom at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his\\nbody. Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear\\nwhether it was his father’s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning\\nrealisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room\\nwithout knowing it. They asked Gregor’s father for explanations, raised\\ntheir arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back\\ntowards their room only very slowly. Meanwhile Gregor’s sister had\\novercome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly\\ninterrupted. She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang\\nlimply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still\\nplaying, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay the\\ninstrument on her mother’s lap who still sat laboriously struggling for\\nbreath where she was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure\\nfrom her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward.\\nUnder his sister’s experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds\\nflew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the\\nbeds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the\\nroom. Gregor’s father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he\\nforgot all the respect he owed to his tenants. He urged them and\\npressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the\\nmiddle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot\\nand thereby brought Gregor’s father to a halt. “I declare here and\\nnow”, he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor’s mother and\\nsister to gain their attention too, “that with regard to the repugnant\\nconditions that prevail in this flat and with this family”—here he\\nlooked briefly but decisively at the floor—“I give immediate notice on\\nmy room. For the days that I have been living here I will, of course,\\npay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed\\nwith some kind of action for damages from you, and believe me it would\\nbe very easy to set out the grounds for such an action.” He was silent\\nand looked straight ahead as if waiting for something. And indeed, his\\ntwo friends joined in with the words: “And we also give immediate\\nnotice.” With that, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the\\ndoor.\\n\\nGregor’s father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his\\nhands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out\\nfor his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept\\nnodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all. Throughout\\nall this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first\\nseen him. His disappointment at the failure of his plan, and perhaps\\nalso because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible for him to\\nmove. He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he\\nwaited. He was not even startled out of this state when the violin on\\nhis mother’s lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on\\nthe floor.\\n\\n“Father, Mother”, said his sister, hitting the table with her hand as\\nintroduction, “we can’t carry on like this. Maybe you can’t see it, but\\nI can. I don’t want to call this monster my brother, all I can say is:\\nwe have to try and get rid of it. We’ve done all that’s humanly\\npossible to look after it and be patient, I don’t think anyone could\\naccuse us of doing anything wrong.”\\n\\n“She’s absolutely right”, said Gregor’s father to himself. His mother,\\nwho still had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough dully,\\nher hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her\\neyes.\\n\\nGregor’s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead.\\nHer words seemed to give Gregor’s father some more definite ideas. He\\nsat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the\\nthree gentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked down at\\nGregor as he lay there immobile.\\n\\n“We have to try and get rid of it”, said Gregor’s sister, now speaking\\nonly to her father, as her mother was too occupied with coughing to\\nlisten, “it’ll be the death of both of you, I can see it coming. We\\ncan’t all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured\\nlike this, we can’t endure it. I can’t endure it any more.” And she\\nbroke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her\\nmother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements.\\n\\n“My child”, said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding,\\n“what are we to do?”\\n\\nHis sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness\\nand tears that had taken hold of her, displacing her earlier certainty.\\n\\n“If he could just understand us”, said his father almost as a question;\\nhis sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as a sign that\\nof that there was no question.\\n\\n“If he could just understand us”, repeated Gregor’s father, closing his\\neyes in acceptance of his sister’s certainty that that was quite\\nimpossible, “then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement\\nwith him. But as it is ...”\\n\\n“It’s got to go”, shouted his sister, “that’s the only way, Father.\\nYou’ve got to get rid of the idea that that’s Gregor. We’ve only harmed\\nourselves by believing it for so long. How can that be Gregor? If it\\nwere Gregor he would have seen long ago that it’s not possible for\\nhuman beings to live with an animal like that and he would have gone of\\nhis own free will. We wouldn’t have a brother any more, then, but we\\ncould carry on with our lives and remember him with respect. As it is\\nthis animal is persecuting us, it’s driven out our tenants, it\\nobviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on\\nthe streets. Father, look, just look”, she suddenly screamed, “he’s\\nstarting again!” In her alarm, which was totally beyond Gregor’s\\ncomprehension, his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed\\nherself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her\\nown mother than stay anywhere near Gregor. She rushed over to behind\\nher father, who had become excited merely because she was and stood up\\nhalf raising his hands in front of Gregor’s sister as if to protect\\nher.\\n\\nBut Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his\\nsister. All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go\\nback into his room, although that was in itself quite startling as his\\npain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal\\nof effort and he was using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly\\nraising it and striking it against the floor. He stopped and looked\\nround. They seemed to have realised his good intention and had only\\nbeen alarmed briefly. Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence.\\nHis mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed\\nagainst each other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister\\nsat next to his father with her arms around his neck.\\n\\n“Maybe now they’ll let me turn round”, thought Gregor and went back to\\nwork. He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had\\nsometimes to stop and take a rest. No-one was making him rush any more,\\neverything was left up to him. As soon as he had finally finished\\nturning round he began to move straight ahead. He was amazed at the\\ngreat distance that separated him from his room, and could not\\nunderstand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little\\nwhile before and almost without noticing it. He concentrated on\\ncrawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a\\nword, not any cry, from his family to distract him. He did not turn his\\nhead until he had reached the doorway. He did not turn it all the way\\nround as he felt his neck becoming stiff, but it was nonetheless enough\\nto see that nothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood\\nup. With his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen\\ncompletely asleep.\\n\\nHe was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut,\\nbolted and locked. The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that\\nhis little legs collapsed under him. It was his sister who had been in\\nso much of a rush. She had been standing there waiting and sprung\\nforward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, and as she\\nturned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents “At last!”.\\n\\n“What now, then?”, Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the\\ndarkness. He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at\\nall. This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being able to\\nactually move around on those spindly little legs until then was\\nunnatural. He also felt relatively comfortable. It is true that his\\nentire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker\\nand weaker and would finally disappear altogether. He could already\\nhardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around\\nit, which was entirely covered in white dust. He thought back of his\\nfamily with emotion and love. If it was possible, he felt that he must\\ngo away even more strongly than his sister. He remained in this state\\nof empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike\\nthree in the morning. He watched as it slowly began to get light\\neverywhere outside the window too. Then, without his willing it, his\\nhead sank down completely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his\\nnostrils.\\n\\nWhen the cleaner came in early in the morning—they’d often asked her\\nnot to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her hurry\\nshe still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she’d arrived and\\nfrom then on it was impossible to sleep in peace—she made her usual\\nbrief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing special. She thought\\nhe was laying there so still on purpose, playing the martyr; she\\nattributed all possible understanding to him. She happened to be\\nholding the long broom in her hand, so she tried to tickle Gregor with\\nit from the doorway. When she had no success with that she tried to\\nmake a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little, and only when she\\nfound she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all\\ndid she start to pay attention. She soon realised what had really\\nhappened, opened her eyes wide, whistled to herself, but did not waste\\ntime to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness\\nof the bedrooms: “Come and ’ave a look at this, it’s dead, just lying\\nthere, stone dead!”\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to\\nmake an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they\\ncould grasp what she was saying. But then, each from his own side, they\\nhurried out of bed. Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders,\\nMrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress; and that is how they went\\ninto Gregor’s room. On the way they opened the door to the living room\\nwhere Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in;\\nshe was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep, and the paleness\\nof her face seemed to confirm this. “Dead?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, looking\\nat the charwoman enquiringly, even though she could have checked for\\nherself and could have known it even without checking. “That’s what I\\nsaid”, replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor’s body\\nanother shove with the broom, sending it sideways across the floor.\\nMrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but\\ndid not complete it. “Now then”, said Mr. Samsa, “let’s give thanks to\\nGod for that”. He crossed himself, and the three women followed his\\nexample. Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: “Just\\nlook how thin he was. He didn’t eat anything for so long. The food came\\nout again just the same as when it went in”. Gregor’s body was indeed\\ncompletely dried up and flat, they had not seen it until then, but now\\nhe was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make\\nthem look away.\\n\\n“Grete, come with us in here for a little while”, said Mrs. Samsa with\\na pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not\\nwithout looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened\\nthe window wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh\\nair had something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of\\nMarch, after all.\\n\\nThe three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in\\namazement for their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about. “Where\\nis our breakfast?”, the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably.\\nShe just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to\\nthe men that they might like to come into Gregor’s room. They did so,\\nand stood around Gregor’s corpse with their hands in the pockets of\\ntheir well-worn coats. It was now quite light in the room.\\n\\nThen the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared in his\\nuniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. All of\\nthem had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her face\\nagainst her father’s arm.\\n\\n“Leave my home. Now!”, said Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and without\\nletting the women from him. “What do you mean?”, asked the middle of\\nthe three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled sweetly. The\\nother two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed\\nthem together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could\\nonly end in their favour. “I mean just what I said”, answered Mr.\\nSamsa, and, with his two companions, went in a straight line towards\\nthe man. At first, he stood there still, looking at the ground as if\\nthe contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new\\npositions. “Alright, we’ll go then”, he said, and looked up at Mr.\\nSamsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted\\npermission again from Mr. Samsa for his decision. Mr. Samsa merely\\nopened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times. At that,\\nand without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the\\nfront hallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some\\ntime before and had been listening to what was being said. Now they\\njumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr.\\nSamsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the\\nconnection with their leader. Once there, all three took their hats\\nfrom the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without a word\\nand left the premises. Mr. Samsa and the two women followed them out\\nonto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust the men’s\\nintentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three\\ngentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps. As they\\nturned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a\\nfew moments later; the further down they went, the more that the Samsa\\nfamily lost interest in them; when a butcher’s boy, proud of posture\\nwith his tray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer\\nthan they were, Mr. Samsa and the women came away from the landing and\\nwent, as if relieved, back into the flat.\\n\\nThey decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation\\nand to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but\\nthey were in serious need of it. So they sat at the table and wrote\\nthree letters of excusal, Mr. Samsa to his employers, Mrs. Samsa to her\\ncontractor and Grete to her principal. The cleaner came in while they\\nwere writing to tell them she was going, she’d finished her work for\\nthat morning. The three of them at first just nodded without looking up\\nfrom what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did\\nnot seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation. “Well?”,\\nasked Mr. Samsa. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her\\nface as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only\\ndo it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical little ostrich\\nfeather on her hat, which had been a source of irritation to Mr. Samsa\\nall the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all\\ndirections. “What is it you want then?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the\\ncleaner had the most respect for. “Yes”, she answered, and broke into a\\nfriendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, “well then,\\nthat thing in there, you needn’t worry about how you’re going to get\\nrid of it. That’s all been sorted out.” Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down\\nover their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were\\nwriting; Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing\\neverything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite\\nclear that she was not to. So, as she was prevented from telling them\\nall about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and,\\nclearly peeved, called out “Cheerio then, everyone”, turned round\\nsharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.\\n\\n“Tonight she gets sacked”, said Mr. Samsa, but he received no reply\\nfrom either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have\\ndestroyed the peace they had only just gained. They got up and went\\nover to the window where they remained with their arms around each\\nother. Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat\\nthere watching for a while. Then he called out: “Come here, then. Let’s\\nforget about all that old stuff, shall we. Come and give me a bit of\\nattention”. The two women immediately did as he said, hurrying over to\\nhim where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished\\ntheir letters.\\n\\nAfter that, the three of them left the flat together, which was\\nsomething they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the\\nopen country outside the town. They had the tram, filled with warm\\nsunshine, all to themselves. Leant back comfortably on their seats,\\nthey discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination\\nthey were not at all bad—until then they had never asked each other\\nabout their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held\\nparticularly good promise for the future. The greatest improvement for\\nthe time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving\\nhouse; what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper\\nthan the current one which had been chosen by Gregor, one that was in a\\nbetter location and, most of all, more practical. All the time, Grete\\nwas becoming livelier. With all the worry they had been having of late\\nher cheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking, Mr. and Mrs.\\nSamsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their\\ndaughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.\\nThey became quieter. Just from each other’s glance and almost without\\nknowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man\\nfor her. And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good\\nintentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the\\nfirst to get up and stretch out her young body.\\n CHAPTER I.\\nDown the Rabbit-Hole\\n\\n\\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\\nconversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice\\n“without pictures or conversations?”\\n\\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\\nclose by her.\\n\\nThere was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\\nso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh\\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,\\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\\n\\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\\nin the world she was to get out again.\\n\\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\\ndeep well.\\n\\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\\npassed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great\\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\\ncupboards as she fell past it.\\n\\n“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall\\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me\\nat home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\\ntop of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)\\n\\nDown, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how\\nmany miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be\\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\\nbe four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt\\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\\npractice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but\\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no\\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\\ngrand words to say.)\\n\\nPresently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\\nthe earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather\\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all\\nthe right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”\\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re\\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what\\nan ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do\\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\\n\\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\\ntalking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”\\n(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\\nno mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s\\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here\\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\\ndreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and\\nsometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer\\neither question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt\\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\\n“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,\\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\\nthe fall was over.\\n\\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\\nit. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\\nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears\\nand whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she\\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\\nfrom the roof.\\n\\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\\nget out again.\\n\\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s\\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\\nbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\\n\\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\\npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\\nout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\\nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\\nthrough the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought\\npoor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\\nhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\\nknew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\\nhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\\nindeed were really impossible.\\n\\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\\ntime she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here\\nbefore,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\\nlabel, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large\\nletters.\\n\\nIt was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was\\nnot going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,\\n“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read\\nseveral nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\\neaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\\n_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\\nsuch as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\\nand that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\\nbleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\\nbottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,\\nsooner or later.\\n\\nHowever, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to\\ntaste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\\nflavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\\nhot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n\\n“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a\\ntelescope.”\\n\\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\\nshe felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”\\nsaid Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I\\nwonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the\\nflame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\\nnot remember ever having seen such a thing.\\n\\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\\nsat down and cried.\\n\\n“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,\\nrather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally\\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\\n“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two\\npeople! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\\nperson!”\\n\\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\\n“EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said\\nAlice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll\\nget into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”\\n\\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which\\nway?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\\non in the common way.\\n\\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\nThe Pool of Tears\\n\\n\\n“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m\\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!”\\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\\nsight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I\\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m\\nsure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be\\nkind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I\\nwant to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every\\nChristmas.”\\n\\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must\\ngo by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending\\npresents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\\n\\n     _Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\\n     Alice’s love_).\\n\\nOh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”\\n\\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.\\n\\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\\n\\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like\\nyou,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop\\nthis moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding\\ngallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\\nfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\\n\\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the\\nDuchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt\\nso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\\nRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,\\nsir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\\nthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\\n\\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How\\nqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\\nI wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling\\na little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who\\nin the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began\\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\\n\\n“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long\\nringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t\\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\\nvery little! Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how\\npuzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.\\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\\nand four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\\nrate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try\\nGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\\nRome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been\\nchanged for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she\\ncrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\\nto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\\ndid not come the same as they used to do:—\\n\\n“How doth the little crocodile\\n    Improve his shining tail,\\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\\n    On every golden scale!\\n\\n“How cheerfully he seems to grin,\\n    How neatly spread his claws,\\nAnd welcome little fishes in\\n    With gently smiling jaws!”\\n\\n\\n“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes\\nfilled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and\\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve\\nmade up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be\\nno use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’\\nI shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\\nthen, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down\\nhere till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden\\nburst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so\\n_very_ tired of being all alone here!”\\n\\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while\\nshe was talking. “How _can_ I have done that?” she thought. “I must be\\ngrowing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure\\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\\nfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\\ndropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\\n\\n“That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and\\nnow for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little\\ndoor: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\\nkey was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than\\never,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this\\nbefore, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”\\n\\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\\nsplash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that\\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by\\nrailway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\\nshe was nine feet high.\\n\\n“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying\\nto find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\\nsure! However, everything is queer to-day.”\\n\\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\\nslipped in like herself.\\n\\n“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?\\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she\\nbegan: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right\\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\\nshe remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of\\na mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather\\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\\nbut it said nothing.\\n\\n“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s\\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all\\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\\nanything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which\\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\\nfright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\\nhad hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like\\ncats.”\\n\\n“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would\\n_you_ like cats if you were me?”\\n\\n“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry\\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d\\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\\nquiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\\nin the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\\npaws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\\nnurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your\\npardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk\\nabout her any more if you’d rather not.”\\n\\n“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\\ntail. “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always\\n_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name\\nagain!”\\n\\n“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\\nconversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not\\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near\\nour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when\\nyou throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\\nof things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you\\nknow, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says\\nit kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\\n“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away\\nfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\\npool as it went.\\n\\nSo she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\\nwon’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the\\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\\nwas quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\\ntrembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my\\nhistory, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”\\n\\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\\nDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice\\nled the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\nA Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\\n\\n\\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the\\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\\nto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\\n\\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\\nnatural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\\nshe had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument\\nwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am\\nolder than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow\\nwithout knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\\ntell its age, there was no more to be said.\\n\\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\\ncalled out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make\\nyou dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\\nMouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she\\nfelt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\\n\\n“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This\\nis the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William\\nthe Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\\nto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\\naccustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\\nMercia and Northumbria—’”\\n\\n“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.\\n\\n“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did\\nyou speak?”\\n\\n“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.\\n\\n“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar,\\nthe earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even\\nStigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”\\n\\n“Found _what_?” said the Duck.\\n\\n“Found _it_,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know\\nwhat ‘it’ means.”\\n\\n“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the\\nDuck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\\narchbishop find?”\\n\\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found\\nit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him\\nthe crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence\\nof his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,\\nturning to Alice as it spoke.\\n\\n“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to\\ndry me at all.”\\n\\n“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move\\nthat the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\\nremedies—”\\n\\n“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half\\nthose long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And\\nthe Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\\ntittered audibly.\\n\\n“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,\\nthat the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”\\n\\n“What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to\\nknow, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to\\nspeak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\\n\\n“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,\\nas you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will\\ntell you how the Dodo managed it.)\\n\\nFirst it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact\\nshape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed\\nalong the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and\\naway,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\\nagain, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all\\ncrowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”\\n\\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\\nthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\\nforehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\\npictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\\nsaid, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”\\n\\n“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.\\n\\n“Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\\nfinger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\\nconfused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”\\n\\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\\nnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly\\none a-piece, all round.\\n\\n“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.\\n\\n“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in\\nyour pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.\\n\\n“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.\\n\\n“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.\\n\\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\\npresented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant\\nthimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all\\ncheered.\\n\\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\\nthat she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\\nto say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as\\nshe could.\\n\\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\\ntheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\\nHowever, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\\nbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.\\n\\n“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why\\nit is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\\nwould be offended again.\\n\\n“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\\nsighing.\\n\\n“It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder\\nat the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on\\npuzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the\\ntale was something like this:—\\n\\n         “Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both\\n         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no\\n         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve\\n         nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear\\n         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’\\n         ‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll\\n         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”\\n\\n“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are\\nyou thinking of?”\\n\\n“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth\\nbend, I think?”\\n\\n“I had _not!_” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\\n\\n“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\\nanxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”\\n\\n“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and\\nwalking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”\\n\\n“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily offended,\\nyou know!”\\n\\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.\\n\\n“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and\\nthe others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only\\nshook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\\n\\n“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was\\nquite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to\\nher daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\\n_your_ temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little\\nsnappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”\\n\\n“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,\\naddressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”\\n\\n“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the\\nLory.\\n\\nAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\\n“Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you\\ncan’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\\nshe’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”\\n\\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\\nbirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\\ncarefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air\\ndoesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice\\nto its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in\\nbed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left\\nalone.\\n\\n“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy\\ntone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best\\ncat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\\nany more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\\nlonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a\\nlittle pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\\neagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was\\ncoming back to finish his story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\nThe Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\\n\\n\\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\\nit muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\\nmy fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\\nferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a\\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\\ngloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\\nthey were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since\\nher swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the\\nlittle door, had vanished completely.\\n\\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\\ncalled out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you\\ndoing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\\na fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\\nat once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\\nmistake it had made.\\n\\n“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How\\nsurprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him\\nhis fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she\\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\\nplate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without\\nknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\\nreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\\nfan and gloves.\\n\\n“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for\\na rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she\\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come\\nhere directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,\\nnurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I\\ndon’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house\\nif it began ordering people about like that!”\\n\\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\\npairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\\ngloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\\nlittle bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\\nthis time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it\\nand put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to\\nhappen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so\\nI’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large\\nagain, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”\\n\\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\\ndown the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t\\ngrow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t\\ndrunk quite so much!”\\n\\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\\nwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\\none elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\\nStill she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\\nof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I\\ncan do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”\\n\\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\\nand she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\\nseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\\nagain, no wonder she felt unhappy.\\n\\n“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t\\nalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\\nrabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and\\nyet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\\n_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\\nthat kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\\none! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\\nwhen I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a\\nsorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”\\n\\n“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am\\nnow? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but\\nthen—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”\\n\\n“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn\\nlessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all\\nfor any lesson-books!”\\n\\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\\nmaking quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\\nshe heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\\n\\n“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!”\\nThen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\\nthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\\nlarge as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\\n\\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\\nthe door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,\\nthat attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll\\ngo round and get in at the window.”\\n\\n“_That_ you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\\nhand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\\ncucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\\n\\nNext came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And\\nthen a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging\\nfor apples, yer honour!”\\n\\n“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and\\nhelp me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)\\n\\n“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”\\n\\n“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)\\n\\n“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\\nwindow!”\\n\\n“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”\\n\\n“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”\\n\\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\\nnow and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at\\nall!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her\\nhand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\\n_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number\\nof cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what\\nthey’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\\n_could!_ I’m sure _I_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!”\\n\\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\\nrumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\\ntalking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other\\nladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill!\\nfetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em\\ntogether first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do\\nwell enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this\\nrope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down!\\nHeads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I\\nfancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t! _You_ do\\nit!—_That_ I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says\\nyou’re to go down the chimney!”\\n\\n“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to\\nherself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in\\nBill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\\nI _think_ I can kick a little!”\\n\\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\\nshe heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)\\nscratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\\nsaying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited\\nto see what would happen next.\\n\\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”\\nthen the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then\\nsilence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy\\nnow—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\\nus all about it!”\\n\\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought\\nAlice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m\\na deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me\\nlike a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”\\n\\n“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.\\n\\n“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice\\ncalled out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”\\n\\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I\\nwonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the\\nroof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\\nAlice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”\\n\\n“A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\\nwindow, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to\\nthis,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that\\nagain!” which produced another dead silence.\\n\\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\\nlittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\\nhead. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make\\n_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it\\nmust make me smaller, I suppose.”\\n\\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\\nbegan shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\\nthrough the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\\nlittle animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\\nwas in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\\nsomething out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\\nappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\\nsafe in a thick wood.\\n\\n“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she\\nwandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the\\nsecond thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that\\nwill be the best plan.”\\n\\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\\narranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\\nhow to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\\nthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\\ngreat hurry.\\n\\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little\\nthing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\\nit; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\\nmight be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\\nspite of all her coaxing.\\n\\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\\nheld it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\\nall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\\nand made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\\nto keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\\nother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\\nover heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\\nvery like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\\n\\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\\nset off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\\nand till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\\n\\n“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant\\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\\nleaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d\\nonly been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that\\nI’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? I\\nsuppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\\nquestion is, what?”\\n\\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\\nThere was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\\nherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\\nbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\\nwas on the top of it.\\n\\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\\ncaterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\\nsmoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of\\nanything else.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\nAdvice from a Caterpillar\\n\\n\\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\\n\\n“Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\\nrather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know\\nwho I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\\nchanged several times since then.”\\n\\n“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain\\nyourself!”\\n\\n“I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m\\nnot myself, you see.”\\n\\n“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely,\\n“for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.”\\n\\n“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you\\nhave to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then\\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little\\nqueer, won’t you?”\\n\\n“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know\\nis, it would feel very queer to _me_.”\\n\\n“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are _you?_”\\n\\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\\nAlice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_\\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I\\nthink, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”\\n\\n“Why?” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\\ngood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\\nstate of mind, she turned away.\\n\\n“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something\\nimportant to say!”\\n\\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\\n\\n“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\\ncould.\\n\\n“No,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\\nand perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For\\nsome minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\\nits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you\\nthink you’re changed, do you?”\\n\\n“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I\\nused—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”\\n\\n“Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all\\ncame different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\\n\\n“Repeat, “_You are old, Father William_,’” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nAlice folded her hands, and began:—\\n\\n“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,\\n    “And your hair has become very white;\\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head—\\n    Do you think, at your age, it is right?”\\n\\n“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,\\n    “I feared it might injure the brain;\\nBut, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,\\n    Why, I do it again and again.”\\n\\n“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,\\n    And have grown most uncommonly fat;\\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—\\n    Pray, what is the reason of that?”\\n\\n“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\\n    “I kept all my limbs very supple\\nBy the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—\\n    Allow me to sell you a couple?”\\n\\n“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak\\n    For anything tougher than suet;\\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—\\n    Pray, how did you manage to do it?”\\n\\n“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,\\n    And argued each case with my wife;\\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\\n    Has lasted the rest of my life.”\\n\\n“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose\\n    That your eye was as steady as ever;\\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—\\n    What made you so awfully clever?”\\n\\n“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”\\n    Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!\\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\\n    Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”\\n\\n\\n“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Not _quite_ right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the\\nwords have got altered.”\\n\\n“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly,\\nand there was silence for some minutes.\\n\\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\\n\\n“What size do you want to be?” it asked.\\n\\n“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one\\ndoesn’t like changing so often, you know.”\\n\\n“I _don’t_ know,” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\\nbefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\\n\\n“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n“Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn’t\\nmind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”\\n\\n“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily,\\nrearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\\n\\n“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she\\nthought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily\\noffended!”\\n\\n“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the\\nhookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\\n\\nThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\\nminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\\nyawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\\nmushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\\n“One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\\ngrow shorter.”\\n\\n“One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_” thought Alice to\\nherself.\\n\\n“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\\naloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\\n\\nAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\\ntrying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was\\nperfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at\\nlast she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\\noff a bit of the edge with each hand.\\n\\n“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\\nviolent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\\n\\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\\nso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\\nmouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\\nlefthand bit.\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\n\\n“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which\\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\\nan immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\\nsea of green leaves that lay far below her.\\n\\n“What _can_ all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where _have_ my\\nshoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?”\\nShe was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\\n\\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\\nshe tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\\nher neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She\\nhad just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\\ngoing to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\\nthe tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\\nhiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\\nface, and was beating her violently with its wings.\\n\\n“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.\\n\\n“I’m _not_ a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”\\n\\n“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\\ntone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing\\nseems to suit them!”\\n\\n“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.\\n\\n“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried\\nhedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those\\nserpents! There’s no pleasing them!”\\n\\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\\n\\n“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon;\\n“but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I\\nhaven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”\\n\\n“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to\\nsee its meaning.\\n\\n“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the\\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I\\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\\nfrom the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”\\n\\n“But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”\\n\\n“Well! _What_ are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to\\ninvent something!”\\n\\n“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day.\\n\\n“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\\ncontempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\\n_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s\\nno use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never\\ntasted an egg!”\\n\\n“I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful\\nchild; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\\nknow.”\\n\\n“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then\\nthey’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”\\n\\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re\\nlooking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\\nme whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”\\n\\n“It matters a good deal to _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not\\nlooking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want\\n_yours_: I don’t like them raw.”\\n\\n“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\\nshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\\nand she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\\nthe other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\\nshe had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\\n\\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\\nand began talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan\\ndone now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m\\ngoing to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my\\nright size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how\\n_is_ that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly\\nupon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\\n“Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them\\n_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she\\nbegan nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go\\nnear the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\nPig and Pepper\\n\\n\\nFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\\nwood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\\nfish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by\\nanother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\\nall over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\\n\\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\\nsaying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the\\nQueen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen.\\nAn invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”\\n\\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\\n\\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\\nfor fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\\ndoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.\\n\\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\\n\\n“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for\\ntwo reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you\\nare; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could\\npossibly hear you.” And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\\nnoise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now\\nand then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\\npieces.\\n\\n“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”\\n\\n“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on\\nwithout attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance,\\nif you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\\nknow.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\\nthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,”\\nshe said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\\nhead. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?”\\nshe repeated, aloud.\\n\\n“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”\\n\\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\\nskimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,\\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\\n\\n“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\\nas if nothing had happened.\\n\\n“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\\n\\n“_Are_ you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first\\nquestion, you know.”\\n\\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really\\ndreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue.\\nIt’s enough to drive one crazy!”\\n\\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\\nremark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for\\ndays and days.”\\n\\n“But what am _I_ to do?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.\\n\\n“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s\\nperfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.\\n\\nThe door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\\none end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\\nin the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,\\nstirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\\n\\n“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to\\nherself, as well as she could for sneezing.\\n\\nThere was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed\\noccasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\\nalternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen\\nthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\\non the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\\n\\n“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why\\nyour cat grins like that?”\\n\\n“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”\\n\\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\\njumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\\nbaby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—\\n\\n“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t\\nknow that cats _could_ grin.”\\n\\n“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”\\n\\n“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite\\npleased to have got into a conversation.\\n\\n“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”\\n\\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\\nbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\\nwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\\nfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\\nthe Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a\\nshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\\n\\n“Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down\\nin an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an\\nunusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\\noff.\\n\\n“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse\\ngrowl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”\\n\\n“Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to\\nget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just\\nthink of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\\nearth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”\\n\\n“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”\\n\\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\\nthe hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\\nbe listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or\\nis it twelve? I—”\\n\\n“Oh, don’t bother _me_,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide\\nfigures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\\nsort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\\nthe end of every line:\\n\\n“Speak roughly to your little boy,\\n    And beat him when he sneezes:\\nHe only does it to annoy,\\n    Because he knows it teases.”\\n\\n\\nCHORUS.\\n(In which the cook and the baby joined):\\n\\n\\n“Wow! wow! wow!”\\n\\n\\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words:—\\n\\n“I speak severely to my boy,\\n    I beat him when he sneezes;\\nFor he can thoroughly enjoy\\n    The pepper when he pleases!”\\n\\n\\nCHORUS.\\n\\n\\n“Wow! wow! wow!”\\n\\n\\n“Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice,\\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready to play\\ncroquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. The cook\\nthrew a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\\n\\nAlice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\\nlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\\n“just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was\\nsnorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\\nitself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\\nthe first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\\n\\nAs soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it\\nout into the open air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,”\\nthought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be\\nmurder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the\\nlittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\\n“Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of\\nexpressing yourself.”\\n\\nThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\\nto see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\\na _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\\nits eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\\nnot like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was only\\nsobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\\nwere any tears.\\n\\nNo, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,”\\nsaid Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\\nnow!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\\nto say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\\n\\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do\\nwith this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so\\nviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time\\nthere could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\\na pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\\nfurther.\\n\\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\\ntrot away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to\\nherself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\\nrather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other\\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\\nto herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she\\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\\na tree a few yards off.\\n\\nThe Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\\nthought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she\\nfelt that it ought to be treated with respect.\\n\\n“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\\nwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little\\nwider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on.\\n“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”\\n\\n“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.\\n\\n“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.\\n\\n“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.\\n\\n“—so long as I get _somewhere_,” Alice added as an explanation.\\n\\n“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long\\nenough.”\\n\\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\\nquestion. “What sort of people live about here?”\\n\\n“In _that_ direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives\\na Hatter: and in _that_ direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a\\nMarch Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”\\n\\n“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.\\n\\n“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad.\\nYou’re mad.”\\n\\n“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.\\n\\n“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”\\n\\nAlice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how\\ndo you know that you’re mad?”\\n\\n“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?”\\n\\n“I suppose so,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry,\\nand wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now _I_ growl when I’m pleased,\\nand wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”\\n\\n“_I_ call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the\\nQueen to-day?”\\n\\n“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited\\nyet.”\\n\\n“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.\\n\\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\\nthings happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\\nit suddenly appeared again.\\n\\n“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly\\nforgotten to ask.”\\n\\n“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\\nin a natural way.\\n\\n“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.\\n\\nAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\\nwhich the March Hare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she\\nsaid to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\\nperhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it\\nwas in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\\nagain, sitting on a branch of a tree.\\n\\n“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.\\n\\n“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing\\nand vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”\\n\\n“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone.\\n\\n“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a\\ngrin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”\\n\\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\\nthe March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\\nnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\\nto about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather\\ntimidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all!\\nI almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\nA Mad Tea-Party\\n\\n\\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very\\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep,\\nI suppose it doesn’t mind.”\\n\\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\\none corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw\\nAlice coming. “There’s _plenty_ of room!” said Alice indignantly, and\\nshe sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\\n\\n“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\\n\\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\\n“I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.\\n\\n“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.\\n\\n“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.\\n\\n“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said\\nthe March Hare.\\n\\n“I didn’t know it was _your_ table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great\\nmany more than three.”\\n\\n“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at\\nAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\\nspeech.\\n\\n“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some\\nseverity; “it’s very rude.”\\n\\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\\nwas, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”\\n\\n“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve\\nbegun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.\\n\\n“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said\\nthe March Hare.\\n\\n“Exactly so,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.\\n\\n“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I\\nsay—that’s the same thing, you know.”\\n\\n“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “You might just as well\\nsay that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”\\n\\n“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what\\nI get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”\\n\\n“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\\ntalking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing\\nas ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”\\n\\n“It _is_ the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the\\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\\nAlice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\\nwriting-desks, which wasn’t much.\\n\\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month\\nis it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\\nand holding it to his ear.\\n\\nAlice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”\\n\\n“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn’t suit\\nthe works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\\n\\n“It was the _best_ butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.\\n\\n“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled:\\n“you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”\\n\\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\\nnothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the _best_ butter,\\nyou know.”\\n\\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What a\\nfunny watch!” she remarked. “It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t\\ntell what o’clock it is!”\\n\\n“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter. “Does _your_ watch tell you what\\nyear it is?”\\n\\n“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it\\nstays the same year for such a long time together.”\\n\\n“Which is just the case with _mine_,” said the Hatter.\\n\\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no\\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quite\\nunderstand you,” she said, as politely as she could.\\n\\n“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little\\nhot tea upon its nose.\\n\\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\\neyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”\\n\\n“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice\\nagain.\\n\\n“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”\\n\\n“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.\\n\\n“Nor I,” said the March Hare.\\n\\nAlice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the\\ntime,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no\\nanswers.”\\n\\n“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk\\nabout wasting _it_. It’s _him_.”\\n\\n“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head\\ncontemptuously. “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”\\n\\n“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat\\ntime when I learn music.”\\n\\n“Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter. “He won’t stand beating.\\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything\\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in\\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a\\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\\ntime for dinner!”\\n\\n(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\\n\\n“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I\\nshouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”\\n\\n“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to\\nhalf-past one as long as you liked.”\\n\\n“Is that the way _you_ manage?” Alice asked.\\n\\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied. “We\\nquarrelled last March—just before _he_ went mad, you know—” (pointing\\nwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert\\ngiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\\n\\n‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\\nHow I wonder what you’re at!’\\n\\n\\nYou know the song, perhaps?”\\n\\n“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.\\n\\n“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—\\n\\n‘Up above the world you fly,\\nLike a tea-tray in the sky.\\n                    Twinkle, twinkle—’”\\n\\n\\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\\n“_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—” and went on so long that they\\nhad to pinch it to make it stop.\\n\\n“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when the\\nQueen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time! Off with his\\nhead!’”\\n\\n“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.\\n\\n“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t\\ndo a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.”\\n\\nA bright idea came into Alice’s head. “Is that the reason so many\\ntea-things are put out here?” she asked.\\n\\n“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time,\\nand we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”\\n\\n“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”\\n\\n“But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Alice ventured\\nto ask.\\n\\n“Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\\n“I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.”\\n\\n“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the\\nproposal.\\n\\n“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up, Dormouse!” And\\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.\\n\\nThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “I wasn’t asleep,” he said in a\\nhoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.”\\n\\n“Tell us a story!” said the March Hare.\\n\\n“Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.\\n\\n“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter, “or you’ll be asleep again\\nbefore it’s done.”\\n\\n“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began\\nin a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\\nthey lived at the bottom of a well—”\\n\\n“What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great interest\\nin questions of eating and drinking.\\n\\n“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\\ntwo.\\n\\n“They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gently remarked;\\n“they’d have been ill.”\\n\\n“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “_very_ ill.”\\n\\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\\nliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: “But\\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?”\\n\\n“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\\n\\n“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t\\ntake more.”\\n\\n“You mean you can’t take _less_,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to\\ntake _more_ than nothing.”\\n\\n“Nobody asked _your_ opinion,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Who’s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter asked triumphantly.\\n\\nAlice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\\nsome tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\\nrepeated her question. “Why did they live at the bottom of a well?”\\n\\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\\nsaid, “It was a treacle-well.”\\n\\n“There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\\nHatter and the March Hare went “Sh! sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily\\nremarked, “If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for\\nyourself.”\\n\\n“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’t interrupt again. I\\ndare say there may be _one_.”\\n\\n“One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\\ngo on. “And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw,\\nyou know—”\\n\\n“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\\n\\n“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\\n\\n“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place\\non.”\\n\\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\\nmoved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\\nplace of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\\n\\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\\ncautiously: “But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle\\nfrom?”\\n\\n“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I should\\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”\\n\\n“But they were _in_ the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\\nto notice this last remark.\\n\\n“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.”\\n\\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\\nsome time without interrupting it.\\n\\n“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all manner of\\nthings—everything that begins with an M—”\\n\\n“Why with an M?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Why not?” said the March Hare.\\n\\nAlice was silent.\\n\\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\\nlittle shriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as\\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say\\nthings are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a\\ndrawing of a muchness?”\\n\\n“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t\\nthink—”\\n\\n“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.\\n\\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\\nthe teapot.\\n\\n“At any rate I’ll never go _there_ again!” said Alice as she picked her\\nway through the wood. “It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in\\nall my life!”\\n\\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\\nleading right into it. “That’s very curious!” she thought. “But\\neverything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.” And\\nin she went.\\n\\nOnce more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\\nglass table. “Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself,\\nand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\\nled into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom\\n(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot\\nhigh: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_—she found\\nherself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds\\nand the cool fountains.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\nThe Queen’s Croquet-Ground\\n\\n\\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\\nwent nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\\none of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me\\nlike that!”\\n\\n“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my\\nelbow.”\\n\\nOn which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the\\nblame on others!”\\n\\n“_You’d_ better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only\\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”\\n\\n“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.\\n\\n“That’s none of _your_ business, Two!” said Seven.\\n\\n“Yes, it _is_ his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for\\nbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”\\n\\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust\\nthings—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\\nthem, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,\\nand all of them bowed low.\\n\\n“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are\\npainting those roses?”\\n\\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\\nvoice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\\n_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So\\nyou see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this\\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\\nout “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw\\nthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\\n\\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\\nthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\\nornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\\nand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\\nby without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\\nthe King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\\n\\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\\nof such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a\\nprocession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their\\nfaces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was,\\nand waited.\\n\\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\\nat her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the\\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\\n\\n“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\\nAlice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”\\n\\n“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely;\\nbut she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after\\nall. I needn’t be afraid of them!”\\n\\n“And who are _these?_” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\\nwho were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on\\ntheir faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\\nthe pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\\nor courtiers, or three of her own children.\\n\\n“How should _I_ know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s\\nno business of _mine_.”\\n\\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\\nmoment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”\\n\\n“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\\nsilent.\\n\\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my\\ndear: she is only a child!”\\n\\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn\\nthem over!”\\n\\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\\n\\n“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\\nthe royal children, and everybody else.\\n\\n“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then,\\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What _have_ you been doing\\nhere?”\\n\\n“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going\\ndown on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”\\n\\n“_I_ see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\\n“Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the\\nsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\\nto Alice for protection.\\n\\n“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large\\nflower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\\nminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\\nothers.\\n\\n“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.\\n\\n“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted\\nin reply.\\n\\n“That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”\\n\\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\\nevidently meant for her.\\n\\n“Yes!” shouted Alice.\\n\\n“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\\nwondering very much what would happen next.\\n\\n“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was\\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\\n\\n“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”\\n\\n“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\\ntiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under\\nsentence of execution.”\\n\\n“What for?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.\\n\\n“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said\\n‘What for?’”\\n\\n“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\\nscream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\\ntone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\\nQueen said—”\\n\\n“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\\nother; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\\nbegan. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\\nin her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\\nhedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\\nthemselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\\n\\nThe chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\\nunder her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\\nhad got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\\nhedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\\nup in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\\nbursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\\ngoing to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\\nhad unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\\nthis, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\\nwanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\\nalways getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\\nsoon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\\n\\nThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\\nthe Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\\nshouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a\\nminute.\\n\\nAlice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\\n“and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully\\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any\\none left alive!”\\n\\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\\nappearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\\nwatching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\\nto herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\\nto.”\\n\\n“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\\nenough for it to speak with.\\n\\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use\\nspeaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one\\nof them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\\nshe had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there\\nwas enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\\n\\n“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a\\ncomplaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear\\noneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at\\nleast, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how\\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the\\narch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\\nground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only\\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!”\\n\\n“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.\\n\\n“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed\\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\\n“—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”\\n\\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.\\n\\n“Who _are_ you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and\\nlooking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.\\n\\n“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to\\nintroduce it.”\\n\\n“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may\\nkiss my hand if it likes.”\\n\\n“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.\\n\\n“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like\\nthat!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.\\n\\n“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book,\\nbut I don’t remember where.”\\n\\n“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called\\nthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish you would\\nhave this cat removed!”\\n\\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\\nsmall. “Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.\\n\\n“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he\\nhurried off.\\n\\nAlice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\\non, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with\\npassion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\\nwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\\n\\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\\nthe other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\\nhelpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\\n\\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t\\nmatter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side\\nof the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\\nfriend.\\n\\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\\na large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\\nwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\\n\\nThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\\nall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\\nwhat they said.\\n\\nThe executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless\\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\\nthing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at _his_ time of life.\\n\\nThe King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\\nbeheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.\\n\\nThe Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in\\nless than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was\\nthis last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and\\nanxious.)\\n\\nAlice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the\\nDuchess: you’d better ask _her_ about it.”\\n\\n“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.”\\nAnd the executioner went off like an arrow.\\n\\nThe Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\\ntime he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so\\nthe King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,\\nwhile the rest of the party went back to the game.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\nThe Mock Turtle’s Story\\n\\n\\n“You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!”\\nsaid the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s,\\nand they walked off together.\\n\\nAlice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\\nsavage when they met in the kitchen.\\n\\n“When _I’m_ a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful\\ntone though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup\\ndoes very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people\\nhot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\\nkind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes\\nthem bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children\\nsweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn’t be\\nso stingy about it, you know—”\\n\\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking\\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t\\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\\na bit.”\\n\\n“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.\\n\\n“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only\\nyou can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as\\nshe spoke.\\n\\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\\nDuchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\\nright height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an\\nuncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\\nbore it as well as she could.\\n\\n“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up\\nthe conversation a little.\\n\\n“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love,\\n’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”\\n\\n“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding\\ntheir own business!”\\n\\n“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her\\nsharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of\\n_that_ is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\\nthemselves.’”\\n\\n“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to\\nherself.\\n\\n“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,”\\nthe Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about\\nthe temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”\\n\\n“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious\\nto have the experiment tried.\\n\\n“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\\nthe moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”\\n\\n“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.\\n\\n“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of\\nputting things!”\\n\\n“It’s a mineral, I _think_,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\\neverything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here.\\nAnd the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is\\nof yours.’”\\n\\n“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last\\nremark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”\\n\\n“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that\\nis—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more\\nsimply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not\\notherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\\notherwise.’”\\n\\n“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely,\\n“if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”\\n\\n“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied,\\nin a pleased tone.\\n\\n“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said\\nAlice.\\n\\n“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “I make you a present\\nof everything I’ve said as yet.”\\n\\n“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they don’t give\\nbirthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out\\nloud.\\n\\n“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\\nlittle chin.\\n\\n“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\\nfeel a little worried.\\n\\n“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and\\nthe m—”\\n\\nBut here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away,\\neven in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was\\nlinked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the\\nQueen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a\\nthunderstorm.\\n\\n“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\\n\\n“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the\\nground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in\\nabout half no time! Take your choice!”\\n\\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\\n\\n“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too\\nmuch frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\\ncroquet-ground.\\n\\nThe other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were\\nresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\\nback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay\\nwould cost them their lives.\\n\\nAll the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling\\nwith the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with\\nher head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the\\nsoldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so\\nthat by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and\\nall the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody\\nand under sentence of execution.\\n\\nThen the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, “Have\\nyou seen the Mock Turtle yet?”\\n\\n“No,” said Alice. “I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”\\n\\n“It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said the Queen.\\n\\n“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history,”\\n\\nAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\\nto the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, _that’s_ a\\ngood thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\\nnumber of executions the Queen had ordered.\\n\\nThey very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If\\nyou don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy\\nthing!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock\\nTurtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\\nexecutions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone\\nwith the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,\\nbut on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it\\nas to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.\\n\\nThe Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\\nshe was out of sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said the Gryphon,\\nhalf to itself, half to Alice.\\n\\n“What _is_ the fun?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Why, _she_,” said the Gryphon. “It’s all her fancy, that: they never\\nexecutes nobody, you know. Come on!”\\n\\n“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly\\nafter it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”\\n\\nThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\\nnearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\\npitied him deeply. “What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the\\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all\\nhis fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!”\\n\\nSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\\nfull of tears, but said nothing.\\n\\n“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your\\nhistory, she do.”\\n\\n“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit\\ndown, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”\\n\\nSo they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\\nherself, “I don’t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn’t begin.”\\nBut she waited patiently.\\n\\n“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real\\nTurtle.”\\n\\nThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\\noccasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant\\nheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\\nsaying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not\\nhelp thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said\\nnothing.\\n\\n“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\\nthough still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the\\nsea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”\\n\\n“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.\\n\\n“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle\\nangrily: “really you are very dull!”\\n\\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\\nquestion,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked\\nat poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the\\nGryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all\\nday about it!” and he went on in these words:\\n\\n“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”\\n\\n“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.\\n\\n“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\\nThe Mock Turtle went on.\\n\\n“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”\\n\\n“_I’ve_ been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so\\nproud as all that.”\\n\\n“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”\\n\\n“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.\\n\\n“Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a\\ntone of great relief. “Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,\\n‘French, music, _and washing_—extra.’”\\n\\n“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom\\nof the sea.”\\n\\n“I couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. “I\\nonly took the regular course.”\\n\\n“What was that?” inquired Alice.\\n\\n“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle\\nreplied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,\\nDistraction, Uglification, and Derision.”\\n\\n“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say. “What is it?”\\n\\nThe Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “What! Never heard of\\nuglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”\\n\\n“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify\\nis, you _are_ a simpleton.”\\n\\nAlice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so\\nshe turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”\\n\\n“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the\\nsubjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with\\nSeaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\\nthat used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\\nFainting in Coils.”\\n\\n“What was _that_ like?” said Alice.\\n\\n“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too\\nstiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.”\\n\\n“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master,\\nthough. He was an old crab, _he_ was.”\\n\\n“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught\\nLaughing and Grief, they used to say.”\\n\\n“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\\ncreatures hid their faces in their paws.\\n\\n“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry\\nto change the subject.\\n\\n“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so\\non.”\\n\\n“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.\\n\\n“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked:\\n“because they lessen from day to day.”\\n\\nThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\\nbefore she made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been\\na holiday?”\\n\\n“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.\\n\\n“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very\\ndecided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\nThe Lobster Quadrille\\n\\n\\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\\nhis eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\\ntwo sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,”\\nsaid the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\\nthe back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\\nrunning down his cheeks, he went on again:—\\n\\n“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said\\nAlice)—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—”\\n(Alice began to say “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and\\nsaid “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\\nLobster Quadrille is!”\\n\\n“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”\\n\\n“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the\\nsea-shore—”\\n\\n“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\\nthen, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”\\n\\n“_That_ generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.\\n\\n“—you advance twice—”\\n\\n“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.\\n\\n“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”\\n\\n“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.\\n\\n“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”\\n\\n“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\\n\\n“—as far out to sea as you can—”\\n\\n“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.\\n\\n“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\\nabout.\\n\\n“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\\n\\n“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock\\nTurtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had\\nbeen jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very\\nsadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\\n\\n“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.\\n\\n“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“Very much indeed,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the\\nGryphon. “We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”\\n\\n“Oh, _you_ sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’ve forgotten the words.”\\n\\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\\nthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\\nforepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\\nand sadly:—\\n\\n“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.\\n“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.\\nSee how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\\nThey are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?\\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?\\n\\n“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\\nWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”\\nBut the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—\\nSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\\n\\n“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.\\n“There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\\nThe further off from England the nearer is to France—\\nThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”\\n\\n\\n“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice,\\nfeeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that\\ncurious song about the whiting!”\\n\\n“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen them,\\nof course?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked herself\\nhastily.\\n\\n“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve\\nseen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”\\n\\n“I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails in\\ntheir mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”\\n\\n“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would\\nall wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;\\nand the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his\\neyes.—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.\\n\\n“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they _would_ go with the\\nlobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to\\nfall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they\\ncouldn’t get them out again. That’s all.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much\\nabout a whiting before.”\\n\\n“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do you\\nknow why it’s called a whiting?”\\n\\n“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”\\n\\n“_It does the boots and shoes_,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\\n\\nAlice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated\\nin a wondering tone.\\n\\n“Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean, what\\nmakes them so shiny?”\\n\\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\\nanswer. “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”\\n\\n“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\\n“are done with a whiting. Now you know.”\\n\\n“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\\n\\n“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\\n“any shrimp could have told you that.”\\n\\n“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still\\nrunning on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back,\\nplease: we don’t want _you_ with us!’”\\n\\n“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no\\nwise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”\\n\\n“Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\\n\\n“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to _me_,\\nand told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’”\\n\\n“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.\\n\\n“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\\nthe Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of _your_ adventures.”\\n\\n“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said\\nAlice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday,\\nbecause I was a different person then.”\\n\\n“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\\n“explanations take such a dreadful time.”\\n\\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\\nsaw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\\nthe two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\\ntheir eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she\\nwent on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\\nabout her repeating “_You are old, Father William_,” to the\\nCaterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\\nTurtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”\\n\\n“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.\\n\\n“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I\\nshould like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to\\nbegin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\\nauthority over Alice.\\n\\n“Stand up and repeat ‘’_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,’” said the\\nGryphon.\\n\\n“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!”\\nthought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got\\nup, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\\nQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\\nvery queer indeed:—\\n\\n“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\\n“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”\\nAs a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\\nTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”\\n\\n[later editions continued as follows\\nWhen the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\\nAnd will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\\nBut, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\\nHis voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\\n\\n\\n“That’s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,” said\\nthe Gryphon.\\n\\n“Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle; “but it sounds\\nuncommon nonsense.”\\n\\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\\nwondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.\\n\\n“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n“She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily. “Go on with the next\\nverse.”\\n\\n“But about his toes?” the Mock Turtle persisted. “How _could_ he turn\\nthem out with his nose, you know?”\\n\\n“It’s the first position in dancing.” Alice said; but was dreadfully\\npuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\\n\\n“Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it\\nbegins ‘_I passed by his garden_.’”\\n\\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\\nwrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—\\n\\n“I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\\nHow the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—”\\n\\n[later editions continued as follows\\nThe Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\\nWhile the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\\nWhen the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\\nWas kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\\nWhile the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\\nAnd concluded the banquet—]\\n\\n\\n“What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,” the Mock Turtle\\ninterrupted, “if you don’t explain it as you go on? It’s by far the\\nmost confusing thing _I_ ever heard!”\\n\\n“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: and Alice was\\nonly too glad to do so.\\n\\n“Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?” the Gryphon\\nwent on. “Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?”\\n\\n“Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,” Alice\\nreplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,\\n“Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her ‘_Turtle Soup_,’ will you, old\\nfellow?”\\n\\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked\\nwith sobs, to sing this:—\\n\\n“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\\nWaiting in a hot tureen!\\nWho for such dainties would not stoop?\\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\nSoo—oop of the e—e—evening,\\n    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\\n\\n“Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,\\nGame, or any other dish?\\nWho would not give all else for two p\\nennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\\nPennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\nSoo—oop of the e—e—evening,\\n    Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!”\\n\\n\\n“Chorus again!” cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun\\nto repeat it, when a cry of “The trial’s beginning!” was heard in the\\ndistance.\\n\\n“Come on!” cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried\\noff, without waiting for the end of the song.\\n\\n“What trial is it?” Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only\\nanswered “Come on!” and ran the faster, while more and more faintly\\ncame, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:—\\n\\n“Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,\\n    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\nWho Stole the Tarts?\\n\\n\\nThe King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\\narrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little\\nbirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\\nstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\\nhim; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one\\nhand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the\\ncourt was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so\\ngood, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d\\nget the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments!”\\nBut there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at\\neverything about her, to pass away the time.\\n\\nAlice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\\nabout them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\\nthe name of nearly everything there. “That’s the judge,” she said to\\nherself, “because of his great wig.”\\n\\nThe judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\\nwig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he\\ndid not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\\n\\n“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,”\\n(she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were\\nanimals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She\\nsaid this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather\\nproud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little\\ngirls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, “jury-men”\\nwould have done just as well.\\n\\nThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are\\nthey doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything\\nto put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”\\n\\n“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply,\\n“for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”\\n\\n“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she\\nstopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the\\ncourt!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,\\nto make out who was talking.\\n\\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\\nthat all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates,\\nand she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell\\n“stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice\\nmuddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.\\n\\nOne of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\\ncould _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\\nvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\\nthat the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\\nat all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he\\nwas obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this\\nwas of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\\n\\n“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.\\n\\nOn this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\\nunrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—\\n\\n“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\\n    All on a summer day:\\nThe Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\\n    And took them quite away!”\\n\\n\\n“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.\\n\\n“Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’s a great\\ndeal to come before that!”\\n\\n“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew\\nthree blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”\\n\\nThe first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand\\nand a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon, your\\nMajesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished\\nmy tea when I was sent for.”\\n\\n“You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you begin?”\\n\\nThe Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\\ncourt, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it\\nwas,” he said.\\n\\n“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.\\n\\n“Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.\\n\\n“Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\\nwrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\\nreduced the answer to shillings and pence.\\n\\n“Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.\\n\\n“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.\\n\\n“_Stolen!_” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made\\na memorandum of the fact.\\n\\n“I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none\\nof my own. I’m a hatter.”\\n\\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\\nwho turned pale and fidgeted.\\n\\n“Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll\\nhave you executed on the spot.”\\n\\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\\nfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his\\nconfusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\\nbread-and-butter.\\n\\nJust at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\\nas long as there was room for her.\\n\\n“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.” said the Dormouse, who was sitting\\nnext to her. “I can hardly breathe.”\\n\\n“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”\\n\\n“You’ve no right to grow _here_,” said the Dormouse.\\n\\n“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re growing\\ntoo.”\\n\\n“Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in\\nthat ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over\\nto the other side of the court.\\n\\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\\nof the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!”\\non which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes\\noff.\\n\\n“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you\\nexecuted, whether you’re nervous or not.”\\n\\n“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\\n“—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the\\nbread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—”\\n\\n“The twinkling of the _what?_” said the King.\\n\\n“It _began_ with the tea,” the Hatter replied.\\n\\n“Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply. “Do you\\ntake me for a dunce? Go on!”\\n\\n“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after\\nthat—only the March Hare said—”\\n\\n“I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\\n\\n“You did!” said the Hatter.\\n\\n“I deny it!” said the March Hare.\\n\\n“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”\\n\\n“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking\\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\\nnothing, being fast asleep.\\n\\n“After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”\\n\\n“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.\\n\\n“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.\\n\\n“You _must_ remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”\\n\\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\\ndown on one knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.\\n\\n“You’re a _very_ poor _speaker_,” said the King.\\n\\nHere one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\\nthe officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\\nexplain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\\nup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\\nhead first, and then sat upon it.)\\n\\n“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice. “I’ve so often read in\\nthe newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at\\napplause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\\ncourt,” and I never understood what it meant till now.”\\n\\n“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the\\nKing.\\n\\n“I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor, as it is.”\\n\\n“Then you may _sit_ down,” the King replied.\\n\\nHere the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\\n\\n“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now we shall get\\non better.”\\n\\n“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxious look at\\nthe Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\\n\\n“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\\nwithout even waiting to put his shoes on.\\n\\n“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the\\nofficers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\\nto the door.\\n\\n“Call the next witness!” said the King.\\n\\nThe next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box in\\nher hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\\ncourt, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.\\n\\n“Give your evidence,” said the King.\\n\\n“Shan’t,” said the cook.\\n\\nThe King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\\n“Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.”\\n\\n“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air, and,\\nafter folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\\nnearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?”\\n\\n“Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.\\n\\n“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.\\n\\n“Collar that Dormouse,” the Queen shrieked out. “Behead that Dormouse!\\nTurn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his\\nwhiskers!”\\n\\nFor some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse\\nturned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had\\ndisappeared.\\n\\n“Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief. “Call the\\nnext witness.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Really, my\\ndear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my\\nforehead ache!”\\n\\nAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling\\nvery curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they\\nhaven’t got much evidence _yet_,” she said to herself. Imagine her\\nsurprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill\\nlittle voice, the name “Alice!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\nAlice’s Evidence\\n\\n\\n“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\\nlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\\na hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\\nupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\\nthey lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of\\ngoldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.\\n\\n“Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\\nbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident\\nof the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of\\nidea that they must be collected at once and put back into the\\njury-box, or they would die.\\n\\n“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice, “until\\nall the jurymen are back in their proper places—_all_,” he repeated\\nwith great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.\\n\\nAlice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\\nthe Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\\ntail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon\\ngot it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she\\nsaid to herself; “I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the\\ntrial one way up as the other.”\\n\\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\\ncourt.\\n\\n“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.\\n\\n“Nothing,” said Alice.\\n\\n“Nothing _whatever?_” persisted the King.\\n\\n“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.\\n\\n“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury. They were\\njust beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White\\nRabbit interrupted: “_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,” he\\nsaid in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as\\nhe spoke.\\n\\n“_Un_important, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on\\nto himself in an undertone,\\n\\n“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he were trying\\nwhich word sounded best.\\n\\nSome of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.”\\nAlice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\\n“but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.\\n\\nAt this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\\nhis note-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from his book, “Rule\\nForty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.”\\n\\nEverybody looked at Alice.\\n\\n“_I’m_ not a mile high,” said Alice.\\n\\n“You are,” said the King.\\n\\n“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.\\n\\n“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a\\nregular rule: you invented it just now.”\\n\\n“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.\\n\\n“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.\\n\\nThe King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. “Consider your\\nverdict,” he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\\n\\n“There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,” said the\\nWhite Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just been\\npicked up.”\\n\\n“What’s in it?” said the Queen.\\n\\n“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a\\nletter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.”\\n\\n“It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to\\nnobody, which isn’t usual, you know.”\\n\\n“Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.\\n\\n“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’s\\nnothing written on the _outside_.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke,\\nand added “It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.”\\n\\n“Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.\\n\\n“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest\\nthing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)\\n\\n“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King. (The jury\\nall brightened up again.)\\n\\n“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they\\ncan’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.”\\n\\n“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter\\nworse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed\\nyour name like an honest man.”\\n\\nThere was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\\nclever thing the King had said that day.\\n\\n“That _proves_ his guilt,” said the Queen.\\n\\n“It proves nothing of the sort!” said Alice. “Why, you don’t even know\\nwhat they’re about!”\\n\\n“Read them,” said the King.\\n\\nThe White Rabbit put on his spectacles. “Where shall I begin, please\\nyour Majesty?” he asked.\\n\\n“Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely, “and go on till you\\ncome to the end: then stop.”\\n\\nThese were the verses the White Rabbit read:—\\n\\n“They told me you had been to her,\\n    And mentioned me to him:\\nShe gave me a good character,\\n    But said I could not swim.\\n\\nHe sent them word I had not gone\\n    (We know it to be true):\\nIf she should push the matter on,\\n    What would become of you?\\n\\nI gave her one, they gave him two,\\n    You gave us three or more;\\nThey all returned from him to you,\\n    Though they were mine before.\\n\\nIf I or she should chance to be\\n    Involved in this affair,\\nHe trusts to you to set them free,\\n    Exactly as we were.\\n\\nMy notion was that you had been\\n    (Before she had this fit)\\nAn obstacle that came between\\n    Him, and ourselves, and it.\\n\\nDon’t let him know she liked them best,\\n    For this must ever be\\nA secret, kept from all the rest,\\n    Between yourself and me.”\\n\\n\\n“That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said the\\nKing, rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”\\n\\n“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown so\\nlarge in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of\\ninterrupting him,) “I’ll give him sixpence. _I_ don’t believe there’s\\nan atom of meaning in it.”\\n\\nThe jury all wrote down on their slates, “_She_ doesn’t believe there’s\\nan atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the\\npaper.\\n\\n“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of\\ntrouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t\\nknow,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at\\nthem with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.\\n“—_said I could not swim_—” you can’t swim, can you?” he added, turning\\nto the Knave.\\n\\nThe Knave shook his head sadly. “Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he\\ncertainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)\\n\\n“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the\\nverses to himself: “‘_We know it to be true_—’ that’s the jury, of\\ncourse—‘_I gave her one, they gave him two_—’ why, that must be what he\\ndid with the tarts, you know—”\\n\\n“But, it goes on ‘_they all returned from him to you_,’” said Alice.\\n\\n“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the\\ntarts on the table. “Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then\\nagain—‘_before she had this fit_—’ you never had fits, my dear, I\\nthink?” he said to the Queen.\\n\\n“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\\nas she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\\nas it lasted.)\\n\\n“Then the words don’t _fit_ you,” said the King, looking round the\\ncourt with a smile. There was a dead silence.\\n\\n“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody\\nlaughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for\\nabout the twentieth time that day.\\n\\n“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”\\n\\n“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the\\nsentence first!”\\n\\n“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.\\n\\n“I won’t!” said Alice.\\n\\n“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\\nmoved.\\n\\n“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by\\nthis time.) “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”\\n\\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\\nher: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\\n\\n“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve\\nhad!”\\n\\n“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her\\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\\nAdventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she\\nhad finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It _was_ a curious\\ndream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”\\nSo Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\\nwhat a wonderful dream it had been.\\n\\n\\nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\\nhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\\nher wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\\nand this was her dream:—\\n\\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\\nlooking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and\\nsee that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\\nthat _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or\\nseemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\\nstrange creatures of her little sister’s dream.\\n\\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the\\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she\\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby\\nwas sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\\naround it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\\nLizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\\nTurtle.\\n\\nSo she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\\nwould change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the\\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling\\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill\\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the\\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\\n(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the\\nlowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\\nTurtle’s heavy sobs.\\n\\nLastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,\\nand make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\\nperhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she\\nwould feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\\ntheir simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer\\ndays.\\n'"
